## `Building Generative AI applications` - [Building Generative AI applications using knowledge graphs in Amazon Neptune](./Building_Generative_AI_applications/README.md)

In this workshop, attendees will leverage generative AI technologies and knowledge graphs to build applications on Amazon Neptune that use Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) data to query an existing graph using natural language questions and construct a knowledge graph to enhance RAG applications (GraphRAG). By the end of this workshop we will have all the pieces needed to build a chatbot application demonstrating these techniques using LlamaIndex, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Neptune.
