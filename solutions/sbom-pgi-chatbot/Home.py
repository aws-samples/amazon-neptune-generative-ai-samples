    """
    A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a critical component of software development and management, helping 
    organizations to improve the transparency, security, and reliability of their software applications. An SBOM acts 
    as an "ingredient list" of libraries and components of a software application that:

Enables software creators to track dependencies within their applications
Provides security personnel the ability to examine and assess the risk of potential vulnerabilities within an 
environment
Provides legal personnel with the information needed to assure that a particular software is in compliance with all 
licensing requirements.
