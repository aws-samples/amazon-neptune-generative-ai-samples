As a down payment on that vision, Whole Foods Market will offer lower prices starting Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples across its stores, with more to come.\nIn addition, Amazon and Whole Foods Market technology teams will begin to integrate Amazon Prime into the Whole Foods Market point-of-sale system, and when this work is complete, Prime members will receive special savings and in-store benefits. The two companies will invent in additional areas over time, including in merchandising and logistics, to enable lower prices for Whole Foods Market customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone. Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality \u2013 we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market\u2019s long-held commitment to the highest standards,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer. \u201cTo get started, we\u2019re going to lower prices beginning Monday on a selection of best-selling grocery staples, including Whole Trade organic bananas, responsibly-farmed salmon, organic large brown eggs, animal-welfare-rated 85% lean ground beef, and more. And this is just the beginning \u2013 we will make Amazon Prime the customer rewards program at Whole Foods Market and continuously lower prices as we invent together. There is significant work and opportunity ahead, and we\u2019re thrilled to get started.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been our mission for 39 years at Whole Foods Market to bring the highest quality food to our customers,\u201d said John Mackey, Whole Foods Market co-founder and CEO. \u201cBy working together with Amazon and integrating in several key areas, we can lower prices and double down on that mission and reach more people with Whole Foods Market\u2019s high-quality, natural and organic food. As part of our commitment to quality, we\u2019ll continue to expand our efforts to support and promote local products and suppliers. We can\u2019t wait to start showing customers what\u2019s possible when Whole Foods Market and Amazon innovate together.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what will be new in Whole Foods Market stores on Monday and what customers can expect over time as the two companies integrate:\n\u2022 Starting Monday, Whole Foods Market will offer lower prices on a selection of best-selling staples across its stores, with much more to come. Customers will enjoy lower prices on products like Whole Trade bananas, organic avocados, organic large brown eggs, organic responsibly-farmed salmon and tilapia, organic baby kale and baby lettuce, animal-welfare-rated 85% lean ground beef, creamy and crunchy almond butter, organic Gala and Fuji apples, organic rotisserie chicken, 365 Everyday Value organic butter, and much more.\n\u2022 In the future, after certain technical integration work is complete, Amazon Prime will become Whole Foods Market\u2019s customer rewards program, providing Prime members with special savings and other in-store benefits.\n\u2022 Whole Foods Market\u2019s healthy and high-quality private label products\u2014including 365 Everyday Value, Whole Foods Market, Whole Paws and Whole Catch\u2014will be available through Amazon.com, AmazonFresh, Prime Pantry and Prime Now.\n\u2022 Amazon Lockers will be available in select Whole Foods Market stores. Customers can have products shipped from Amazon.com to their local Whole Foods Market store for pick up or send returns back to Amazon during a trip to the store.\nThis is just the beginning \u2013 Amazon and Whole Foods Market plan to offer more in-store benefits and lower prices for customers over time as the two companies integrate logistics and point-of-sale and merchandising systems.\nWhole Foods Market will continue to grow its team and create jobs in local communities as it opens new stores, hires new team members, and expands its support of local farmers and artisans. The company will maintain operations under the Whole Foods Market brand, preserve its high standards and commitment to providing the finest natural and organic foods, and continue to source from trusted vendors and partners around the world. John Mackey will remain as CEO and Whole Foods Market\u2019s headquarters will stay in Austin, Texas.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 9, 2016-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans for a new technology development center in downtown Minneapolis that will create 100 full-time, technology-focused jobs. To celebrate Amazon\u2019s expansion in the Minneapolis community, Amazon is donating plus mentoring support to local nonprofit Code Savvy to help the group\u2019s mission of encouraging youth\u2019s understanding of coding and promoting diversity in the technology industry. Amazon currently has hundreds of employees in Minnesota and is in the process of hiring an additional 1,000 full-time employees for its new Shakopee, Minnesota, fulfillment center.\n\u201cAmazon is always looking for the best and brightest software engineers to join our team,\u201d said Dave Glick, vice president of operations technology for Amazon. \u201cThe commitment to education, growth of the local high-tech industry, and caliber of technical talent in Minneapolis make it an ideal place for our expansion. We\u2019re excited to create new technology jobs in Minneapolis and look forward to growing our operations technology team to help us develop cutting-edge software applications that fuel Amazon\u2019s rapidly growing operations, fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\u201d\n\u201cOn behalf of the City of Minneapolis, it is my pleasure to extend a warm welcome to Amazon,\u201d said Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges. \u201cMinneapolis is growing rapidly, and our expanding workforce is ready for the new full-time, high-technology jobs Amazon will bring. Welcome to our community.\u201d\nThe Minneapolis office will include multiple roles like software development engineers and managers who will be tasked with developing and innovating technology solutions that enhance Amazon\u2019s operations. Amazon employees receive comprehensive benefits, including healthcare, 401(k) and company stock awards, starting on day one, as well as generous maternity and parental leave benefits.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that Amazon is bringing 100 new, high-tech jobs to Minneapolis,\u201d remarked Representative Raymond Dehn (DFL-Minneapolis). \u201cNot only will they be creating good paying jobs in an area of need, they\u2019ve chosen to donate to Code Savvy, a non-profit that teaches inner-city kids to code so they may have a better future. Minneapolis has been a leader in technology and I\u2019m pleased to welcome Amazon to our community.\u201d\nAs part of the company\u2019s expansion in Minneapolis and its commitment to the local community, Amazon will be donating to Code Savvy to fund the nonprofit\u2019s Technovation[MN] program. The program focuses on technology entrepreneurship led by girls that helps participants build problem-solving apps and create business plans. Amazon employees at the new office will also be offering mentoring support to Code Savvy.\n\u201cCode Savvy is so thrilled that Amazon is expanding their technology team to the Minneapolis area and has honored us with a donation to our all-girl entrepreneurship and app development program, Technovation[MN]. Welcome to the Code Savvy community!\u201d said Jean Weiss, executive director of Code Savvy. \u201cIn addition to this much needed funding, we are looking forward to the Amazon team participating as mentors in the program and hosting teams on field trips at their sites. Our thriving tech community will be a great place for Amazon\u2019s expanded venture and we look forward to working closely with them on this and other Code Savvy programs going forward.\u201d\nTo learn more about job opportunities with Amazon in Minnesota, visit www.amazon.jobs\/minneapolis-mn.\nAmazon.com opened on the World Wide Web in July 1995.

{"raw_text":"Any European Software Developer or Business Now Has Easy Access to Highly Scalable, Reliable, Fast and Inexpensive Data Storage in the Cloud\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 6, 2007--Amazon Web Services today launched European storage for its popular Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), allowing software developers and businesses to store their data in Europe. Amazon S3 is a storage service in the cloud offering software developers and businesses low-cost access to the same scalable and reliable storage infrastructure Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. Since its launch in March 2006, Amazon S3 has grown rapidly and now holds over 10 billion objects. Developers and businesses can build on Amazon S3 today at http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/s3.\n\"Since the U.S. launch of Amazon S3, developers in Europe have asked us to add the ability to store data in Europe. They wanted the same high quality, low cost service, but with lower latency and local data storage. We've been working hard to make this a reality and are excited to offer Amazon S3 from European datacenters,\" said Adam Selipsky, Vice President of Product Management and Developer Relations for Amazon Web Services. \"We are actively working on other important requirements, such as accepting payment in Euros and providing local language support, but are pleased to offer a release that we think many European businesses and developers will find useful right now.\"\nAmazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It's designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. The service gives any developer access to Amazon's data storage infrastructure and aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.\n\"We are very excited about the development of a European storage solution for Amazon S3,\" said Martin Gill, Head of New Media for Comic Relief, an organization committed to raising poverty awareness. \"Following a very successful 'test drive' of the US-hosted Amazon S3 service during our work supporting 'Idol Gives Back' last April, we saw this service being a core resource for the development of Comic Relief's digital vision for our UK fundraising activities. The US service stood up under substantial load and showed us just how affordable, easy to use, and scalable the service is. Without it we would have missed some great opportunities. Enormous scalability, combined with the legal benefits of holding data and assets within the EU, makes the European storage of Amazon S3 a brilliant early Christmas present for us!\"\n\"Amazon S3 is allowing us to store massive amounts of digital media in a trusted place and have a pay-as-you-go scheme at the same time,\" said Klaas Waslander, Chief Technical Officer for Albumprinter, a leading provider of personalized photo product solutions for retailers, internet companies and other photo channels in Europe and the US. \"When we thought about the fact that this is the same service that Amazon uses in its own retail operations it made us confident to use it in our own. With the availability of Amazon S3 from datacenters in Europe we are now able to use storage behind-the-scenes for all of our European customers, which is fantastic news for us.\"\nAmazon S3 lets developers pay only for what they consume and charges no up-front or minimum fee. The following are US$ prices for Amazon S3 in Europe:\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) provides technology services that give businesses access to Amazon's own-back technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business. These in-the-cloud web services make it possible for any business to reach the scale of major internet players such as Amazon.com, but without the expensive price tag these companies must pay to build and maintain such reliable, secure, and scalable infrastructure. Businesses can use AWS to achieve this level of web scale with zero up-front investment and low, pay-as-you-go pricing. More than 290,000 developers have signed up to use AWS since its inception. Amazon Web Services LLC is an Amazon.com company.

{"raw_text":"Amazon expands the long term partnership with ATSG \u2013 leases 10 additional 767-300 dedicated Amazon cargo aircraft, increasing the fleet to 50 aircraft\nThe Amazon Air operation launched two years ago and in that time, 40 aircraft have joined the fleet operating out of 21 air gateways, and more are on the way\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2018-- (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2013 Amazon continues to invest in ways to provide fast, free delivery for customers. Today, the company announced an expansion of its partnership with Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (ATSG) by leasing an additional 10 aircraft to support Amazon\u2019s growth. Amazon previously leased 40 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft in 2016, 20 of those with ATSG, all of which are now flying serving customers in the Amazon Air network. The 10 additional cargo planes will consist of Boeing 767-300 aircraft, will be operated on Amazon\u2019s behalf by an ATSG airline, and will join the air cargo operation over the next two years.\nAmazon Air\u2019s operation launched in 2016 supporting package delivery to the rapidly growing number of customers who love fast delivery, great prices and vast selection. With advanced algorithms and software used for capacity and route planning, the Amazon Air operation can transport hundreds of thousands of packages per day. In addition, with Amazon\u2019s dedicated air network, Amazon is able to deliver packages to its customers faster \u2013 40 aircraft are flying in and out of gateway operations at over 20 airports, making two-day shipping possible almost anywhere in the U.S.\n\u201cOur customers love massive selection and fast delivery, and the Amazon Air capacity we are building enables Prime delivery speeds for customers from Seattle, Washington to Miami, Florida,\u201d said Dave Clark, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations at Amazon. \u201cBy expanding the Amazon Air network through our partnership with ATSG we\u2019re able to ensure we have the capacity to quickly and efficiently deliver packages to customers for years to come.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to expand and extend our partnership in support of Amazon\u2019s exceptional ability to provide reliable and fast delivery to its customers,\u201d said Joe Hete, President and CEO of ATSG. \u201cAs the world\u2019s leading source of customer-dedicated 767 cargo aircraft, we have the access to aircraft and are uniquely qualified to support Amazon for many years to come.\u201d\nAmazon will open a new Regional Air Hub next year at Fort Worth Alliance Airport, and the Air Hub at the Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky International Airport will open in 2021. Recently, Amazon also announced a gateway operation to launch in Wilmington, Ohio, in 2019 as well as an expanded operation in Rockford, Illinois. Since its launch, Amazon\u2019s air cargo operation has invested millions of dollars and created thousands of new jobs at locations across the U.S.\nAmazon has launched several initiatives to ensure fast delivery speeds and supply chain capacity for its customers, including its Delivery Service Partner program, Amazon Flex, the company\u2019s mobile application that allows individuals to sign-up, be vetted and begin delivering for Amazon, a dedicated network of over 10,000 trailers to increase trucking capacity and, now, the expanded fleet of air cargo planes. These efforts join Amazon\u2019s robust worldwide network of more than 185 fulfillment centers where the company uses high-end algorithms, robotics, machine learning and other technological innovations to increase delivery speeds for customers. Amazon is now bringing the same technological expertise to efforts in the transportation space to increase shipping capacity for customers.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Fully managed MongoDB compatible database service designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable, and highly available\nCapital One, Dow Jones, and The Washington Post among initial customers using Amazon DocumentDB\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. Developers can use the same MongoDB application code, drivers, and tools as they do today to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon DocumentDB and enjoy improved performance, scalability, and availability without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Customers can easily migrate their on-premises or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) MongoDB databases to Amazon DocumentDB with virtually no downtime using the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). There are no up-front investments required to use Amazon DocumentDB, and customers only pay for the capacity they use. To get started with Amazon DocumentDB, visit https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/documentdb.\nAWS customers use MongoDB as a document database to store, retrieve, and manage semi-structured data. Customers like using the MongoDB Application Programming Interface (API) and expressive language query to help them quickly build and evolve applications, but they often only take advantage of a fraction of the functionality the API offers. Customers also find it challenging to build performant, highly available applications on MongoDB that can quickly scale to multiple Terabytes (TBs) and hundreds of thousands of reads and writes-per-second because of the complexity that comes with setting up and managing MongoDB clusters. As a result, customers spend a lot of time and expense managing MongoDB clusters at scale, including dealing with the undifferentiated heavy lifting of securing, patching, and operating MongoDB. Just like on-premises deployments, managed MongoDB systems face data replication challenges and they suffer from long recovery times in the event of failure. As a result, customers are struggling to get the performance, scalability, and availability their growing applications need over time.\nAmazon DocumentDB is designed from the ground up to give customers the performance, scalability, and availability they need when operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads at scale. Amazon DocumentDB implements the Apache 2.0 open source MongoDB 3.6 API by emulating the responses that a MongoDB client expects from a MongoDB server, allowing customers to use their existing MongoDB drivers and tools with Amazon DocumentDB. Amazon DocumentDB uses a unique, distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that automatically scales up to 64 TB of data per cluster, so customers can save time and money by not having to worry about capacity planning or over provisioning storage infrastructure. Amazon DocumentDB reduces database I\/O by writing only database changes to the storage layer, avoiding slow, inefficient, and expensive data replication across network links. Together with optimizations like advanced query processing, connection pooling, and optimized recovery and rebuild, Amazon DocumentDB achieves twice the throughput of currently available MongoDB solutions. Additionally, with Amazon DocumentDB\u2019s architecture, the storage and compute are decoupled, allowing each to scale independently, and developers can increase the read capacity to millions of requests per second by adding up to 15 low latency read replicas in minutes, regardless of data size. Amazon DocumentDB is designed for 99.99% availability by using the AWS multi-Availability Zone (AZ) technology and replicating six copies of a customer\u2019s data across three AWS Availability Zones (AZs). Amazon DocumentDB\u2019s architecture also allows customers to save money when running MongoDB databases as customers can get started with one instance for durability and only requires a second instance for high availability.\n\u201cWhile other companies have taken the same emulation approach we have to providing a MongoDB compatible service, nobody has built the unique, distributed, fault-tolerant, highly scalable, self-healing storage system that AWS has to work seamlessly with MongoDB,\u201d said Shawn Bice, Vice President, Non-Relational Databases at AWS. \u201cTo meet developers\u2019 needs, we looked at multiple different approaches to supporting MongoDB workloads and concluded that the best way to improve the customer experience was to build a new purpose-built document database from the ground up, while supporting the same MongoDB APIs that our customers currently use and like. This effort took more than two years of development, and we\u2019re excited to make this available to our customers today.\u201d\nAmazon DocumentDB automatically and continuously backs up data to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and provides up to 35 days of point-in-time recovery with no downtime or performance degradation. Amazon DocumentDB supports network isolation using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), encryption-at-rest using keys customers create and control through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), and encryption-in-transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS). To get started, customers can provision their Amazon DocumentDB clusters with a few simple clicks in the AWS Management Console or with the AWS Command Line Interface and launch their MongoDB-compatible database in minutes. Amazon DocumentDB is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland), and will expand to additional AWS Regions in the coming year.\nCapital One, a leading information-based technology company and digital banking leader, has taken a cloud-first approach to software development. \u201cOur developers love the document model as it enables them to move fast and iterate quickly when building applications,\u201d said Sunjay Pandey, Vice President, Capital One. \u201cAmazon DocumentDB integrates deeply with AWS services and provides us with a robust, highly scalable, and cost effective database service that meets our operational requirements. With Amazon DocumentDB, our developers will be able to move faster and focus more on innovating on behalf of our customers versus managing a database.\u201d\nDow Jones publishes some of the world's most trusted, breaking, and exclusive business news and financial information in a variety of media, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and related statistics and the Dow Jones Newswire. \u201cDow Jones uses a number of specialized databases including MongoDB to provide a variety of services for our customers,\u201d said Ramin Beheshti, Chief Product & Technology Officer. \u201cWe are excited about collaborating with AWS around Amazon DocumentDB, which meets key needs we expressed to AWS in order to simplify our operations and free up our developers to invest in innovative experiences for our customers rather than undifferentiated operations.\"\nThe Washington Post is one of the leading national and global news organizations reaching more than 90 million readers a month. \u201cTo provide our readers with the best possible experience, The Washington Post engineering team leverages AWS database services because they offer self-service provisioning without compromising operational excellence,\u201d said Patrick Cullen, Director of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at The Washington Post. \u201cFrom automated backup to multi-AZ failover, Amazon DocumentDB provides all the key APIs and features we need to build the world class systems that power both our Arc Publishing business and our machine learning platform. Document databases support the unstructured data that is prevalent in media, and with Amazon DocumentDB, we can now leverage AWS for all our critical database needs.\u201d\nHudl provides coaches, athletes, and analysts the tools to study and improve performance through video and stats. \u201cAt Hudl, we utilize a significant amount of AWS services, as we're always looking for opportunities to get out of the business of managing our own infrastructure,\u201d said Brian Kaiser, CTO at Hudl. \u201cOur developers love the MongoDB API and document model. We're very excited about the launch of Amazon DocumentDB, as it fits perfectly into our short-term and long-term architectural plans. Amazon DocumentDB has the capabilities we're looking for, and it's great to see Amazon DMS support from day one.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 60 Availability Zones (AZs) within 20 geographic regions around the world, spanning the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and the UK. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"Plymouth Housing will receive to provide permanent supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness in Seattle; will go to the Arlington Community Foundation to increase access to affordable housing for low-income families and veterans\nThe gift will help create additional housing units and support services in both regions for thousands of community members\nBeginning today, Amazon will also match employee contributions to select charities addressing housing and homelessness in its HQ regions\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 11, 2019-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014Since 2016, Amazon has made in-kind and cash donations to its Seattle nonprofit partners Mary\u2019s Place and FareStart, including a first-of-its-kind family shelter within an Amazon building for Mary\u2019s Place and classroom and restaurant space for FareStart\u2019s job training program for people experiencing homelessness or living in poverty. The collective value of these donations, including annual rent, is more than , with Mary\u2019s Place alone receiving in in-kind and cash donations over the next 10 years.\nToday, Amazon announced an initial total donation to Plymouth Housing and the Arlington Community Foundation, based in the company\u2019s two headquarters regions \u2013 Seattle and Arlington, VA. The gifts will support both nonprofits in their missions to improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable residents by increasing access to additional housing units for families, veterans, and single adults experiencing chronic homelessness or in need of affordable housing. In addition to these initial gifts \u2013 to Plymouth Housing and to the Arlington Community Foundation \u2013 the company will match employee donations through September 30, 2019 to select charities that address housing and homelessness in both regions.\n\u201cAs the city of Seattle continues to look for solutions to homelessness, this generous donation from Amazon will help us meet the immediate needs of thousands of people in the coming years,\u201d said Paul Lambros, CEO of Plymouth Housing. \u201cChronic homelessness is a disabling condition and a complex issue requiring the attention and support of the whole community. We\u2019re very grateful to Amazon for continuing to step up in addressing this pressing need.\u201d\n\u201cSince 2000, Arlington County has lost nearly 90% of its market affordable housing stock. Amazon\u2019s donation is a significant investment in our community and will support critical issues like housing affordability that are important to Northern Virginians,\u201d said Jennifer Owens, President and CEO, Arlington Community Foundation. \u201cOur veterans and working families deserve an appropriate standard of living that is healthy, safe, and makes for a vibrant community. This gift is a great contribution toward that cause.\u201d\n\u201cHomelessness and affordable housing are real concerns in Seattle and the Washington, DC region \u2013 as neighbors in both, we made these donations to Plymouth Housing and the Arlington Community Foundation because of their work and progress on housing stability and helping families improve their quality of life,\u201d said Jay Carney, SVP, Global Corporate Affairs at Amazon. \u201cWe believe this gift can help offer additional housing and support services for our neighbors in need. In addition, together with our employees, we will donate to nonprofits located in Washington State, Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia, whose missions support affordable housing and people experiencing homelessness.\u201d\nBeginning today, Amazon also launched an employee match campaign to encourage employees to donate to 20 select nonprofits addressing housing and homelessness in the company\u2019s two headquarter regions. Amazon will match the donation one-for-one, up to , through September 30. The select nonprofits include:\nPlymouth Housing provides permanent housing to single men and women experiencing chronic homelessness, those sleeping on the streets and in cars while dealing with significant physical or behavioral health conditions. Amazon\u2019s donation to Plymouth Housing will help provide significant support to the organization, which pairs permanent homes with services to address physical disabilities, mental health, or chemical dependency, helping prevent residents from experiencing homelessness again. Plymouth serves over 1,000 formerly homeless Seattle residents each year in 14 local apartment buildings.\nThe Arlington Community Foundation was established in 1991 to serve as a permanent community endowment built by the gifts and charitable legacies of individuals, families, and businesses for the betterment of Arlington County. As a grant maker, convener, and sponsor of special initiatives, the Community Foundation strives to strengthen local nonprofits, encourage better understanding of the needs of Arlingtonians, address the most critical issues of our time, and to ensure that our community provides opportunity for everyone. Its focus areas include homelessness prevention, education, arts, youth, and families in need.\nAbout Amazon in the Community\nAmazon is committed to helping all children and young adults, especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities, have the resources and skills they need to build their best future.

{"raw_text":"The new fulfillment centers in Akron and Rossford will total more than 1.4 million-square-feet\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 22, 2019-- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open two new Ohio fulfillment centers, one in Akron and the other in Rossford, creating more than 2,500 full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits and opportunities to work alongside Amazon robotics in an industry-leading workplace.\n\u201cOhio has been a great place to do business, serve customers and create jobs; as a result, we are thrilled to develop two state-of-the-art fulfillment centers in Akron and Rossford,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon\u2019s Vice President of Global Customer Fulfillment. \u201cWe're excited to grow our team in the Buckeye state, which now includes more than 8,500 Amazonians, and be part of the larger Ohio community.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon continues to demonstrate confidence in the great workforce and e-commerce business climate we have in Ohio,\u201d said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to welcome two additional investments from Amazon, which bring thousands of new jobs to Ohio and cutting-edge facilities to Akron and Rossford.\u201d\nEach fulfillment center is more than 700,000 square feet and will be used to pick, pack and ship small items to customers such as books, electronics and toys. All associates will go through hours of safety training and ongoing coaching and will have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs such as Career Choice in which the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, over 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families. In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.\n\u201cAmazon has been a strong partner in Ohio, creating more than 8,500 jobs here that have brought benefits and health care on day one,\u201d said J.P. Nauseef, JobsOhio President and Chief Investment Officer. \u201cJobsOhio and our regional and local partners welcome these new facilities that will employ 2,500 Ohioans, revitalize an Akron neighborhood, and bring Amazon\u2019s largest Northwest Ohio investment to Rossford.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited to have Amazon build on to its already strong business relationship with Ohio by selecting the City of Akron for its new facility,\u201d said Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan. \u201cOnce completed, this fulfillment center will provide even more opportunities for good jobs to people seeking employment in and around Akron.\u201d\n\u201cRossford is home to an increasingly diverse business community, we are thrilled that Amazon will be joining those ranks by locating its new fulfillment center here,\u201d said Rossford Mayor Neil A. MacKinnon III. \u201dWe welcome Amazon as our new neighbor and look forward to the job creation Amazon will bring for members of our community and the surrounding areas.\u201d\nAn Amazon presence in Ohio means more than just the jobs provided within the fulfillment center\u2019s four walls. In addition to full-benefit, great jobs inside its buildings, the company has brought thousands of jobs in construction and services. Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than in the state through its customer fulfillment and cloud infrastructure, and compensation to its employees. Using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in the state have created an additional 19,000 indirect jobs on top of the company\u2019s direct hires.\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based right here in Ohio. There are more than 55,000 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Ohio growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services.\nThese projects are being developed in partnership with Seefried Industrial Properties, Duke Realty, the Development Finance Authority of Summit County, and the Wood County Port Authority.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"The new facility in Allegheny County will total more than 1 million-square-feet\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 30, 2019-- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open its 15th Pennsylvanian operations facility in Pittsburgh, creating more than 800 new, full-time jobs starting at an hour with comprehensive benefits and opportunities in an industry-leading workplace.\n\u201cPennsylvania is a great state for business and Amazon is excited to continue its growth and investment with our newest fulfillment center in Allegheny County,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, vice president of global customer fulfillment, Amazon. \u201cFor nearly a decade, the Keystone state has been key to Amazon\u2019s ability to serve our incredible customers and provide great selection and super-fast shipping speeds across the Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. Since 2010, the company has invested more than in the state through its local fulfillment center and cloud infrastructure, research facilities, and compensation to thousands of employees. We are excited to create more than 800 new full-time jobs, in addition to the 10,000 current employees across the state, who receive industry-leading pay and benefits starting on day one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great win any time a business comes in and pledges to create 800 new jobs,\u201d said Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf. \u201cThis is a significant investment for Pennsylvania and I applaud Amazon for selecting our commonwealth as the location for this facility.\u201d\nThe fulfillment center will be more than 1 million square feet and Amazon employees will pick, pack and ship larger customer items, such as sports equipment, patio furniture, kayaks and larger home goods. All associates will go through hours of safety training and ongoing coaching and will have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs, such as Career Choice, in which the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families. In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores that Amazon has never taken its eyes off Pittsburgh. A new, from-the-ground-up fulfillment center will increase the count of several local Amazon facilities \u2013 including a growing engineering center \u2013 that provide, or will provide, thousands of well-paying jobs in the region,\u201d said Pittsburgh Regional Alliance (PRA) President Mark A. Thomas. \u201cThe PRA \u2013 the economic development marketing affiliate of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development \u2013 was happy to bring together a number of partners to showcase the Pittsburgh assets that support the company\u2019s expansion plans. These include proven strength in distribution and logistics, pad-ready parcels with nearby interstate and highway access and a workforce pipeline that meets the hiring demands of enterprises, like Amazon, on the leading edge of innovation.\u201d\n\"This is great news for our region. We appreciate the ongoing partnership with Amazon that began years ago. Their continued expansion in this region is more evidence that the ecodistrict of logistics, warehouse and manufacturing in the airport corridor is starting to gain momentum,\u201d said County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, Allegheny County. \u201cAmazon\u2019s decision also reflects their continued confidence in this county\u2019s, this region\u2019s and this state\u2019s economy. The county, Port Authority and Airport Authority are proud to continue working with so many partners to show that this region is a good place to do business.\u201d\nAn addition to Amazon\u2019s presence in Pennsylvania means more than just the great jobs with full benefits provided within the fulfillment center\u2019s four walls. Each additional Amazon facility adds to the thousands of jobs in construction and services the company has brought to Pennsylvania. Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than in the state through its customer fulfillment and cloud infrastructure and compensation to its employees. Using the methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments in the state have created an additional 8,000 indirect jobs on top of the company's direct hires.\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based right here in Pennsylvania. There are more than 68,500 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Pennsylvania growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Commits to net zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030\nOrders 100,000 fully-electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever for electric delivery vehicles\nInvests in reforestation projects around the world to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere now\nLaunches new sustainability website to report progress on commitments\nWASHINGTON, D.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 19, 2019-- Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Global Optimism announced The Climate Pledge, a commitment to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early. Amazon today becomes the first signatory of this pledge. The Climate Pledge calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040\u2014a decade ahead of the Paris Accord\u2019s goal of 2050.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190919005609\/en\/\nCompanies that sign The Climate Pledge agree to:\n\u2022 Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies;\n\u2022 Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\n\u201cWe\u2019re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue\u2014we\u2019ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. \u201cIf a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon\u2014which delivers more than 10 billion items a year\u2014can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can. I\u2019ve been talking with other CEOs of global companies, and I\u2019m finding a lot of interest in joining the pledge. Large companies signing The Climate Pledge will send an important signal to the market that it\u2019s time to invest in the products and services the signatories will need to meet their commitments.\u201d\n\u201cBold steps by big companies will make a huge difference in the development of new technologies and industries to support a low carbon economy,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s former climate change chief and founding partner of Global Optimism. \u201cWith this step, Amazon also helps many other companies to accelerate their own decarbonization. If Amazon can set ambitious goals like this and make significant changes at their scale, we think many more companies should be able to do the same and will accept the challenge. We are excited to have others join.\u201d\nBy joining The Climate Pledge and agreeing to decarbonize on a faster time horizon, signatories will play a critical role in stimulating investment in the development of low carbon products and services that will be required to help companies meet the pledge. Amazon\u2019s previously announced investment in Rivian is an example of this. Rivian is a producer of emissions-free electric vehicles with its headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan and a manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. The investment will accelerate the production of electric vehicles critical to reducing emissions from transportation. To further advance this goal, Amazon today announced the order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, with vans starting to deliver packages to customers in 2021. Amazon plans to have 10,000 of the new electric vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030 \u2013 saving 4 million metric tons of carbon per year by 2030.\n80% Renewable Energy by 2024 and 100% Renewable Energy By 2030\nTwo years ago, Amazon made a long-term commitment to power its global infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. Amazon is now pledging to reach 80% renewable energy by 2024 and 100% renewable energy by 2030 on its path to net zero carbon by 2040. Major investments in renewable energy are a critical step to address its carbon footprint globally. To date, Amazon has launched 15 utility-scale wind and solar renewable energy projects that will generate over 1,300 MW of renewable capacity and deliver more than 3.8 million MWh of clean energy annually \u2013 enough to power 368,000 U.S. homes. Amazon has also installed more than 50 solar rooftops on fulfillment centers and sort centers around the globe that generate 98 MW of renewable capacity and deliver 130,000 MWh of clean energy annually.\nAmazon is launching the Right Now Climate Fund, committing to restore and protect forests, wetlands, and peatlands around the world in partnership with The Nature Conservancy. The Right Now Climate Fund will help remove millions of metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere over the lifetime of the project, and create economic opportunity for thousands of people.\n\u201cThe science is clear: healthy forests, grasslands, and wetlands are some of the most effective tools we have to address climate change\u2014but we must act now to take natural climate solutions to scale,\u201d said Sally Jewell, interim CEO, The Nature Conservancy. \u201cAmazon is recognized as an innovator that drives real change. A commitment of this size is an exciting opportunity, with the potential to drive transformational change. We applaud Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge and their aggressive ambition to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and look forward to our high-impact collaboration.\u201d\nAmazon today launched a new sustainability website to report on its commitments, initiatives, and performance. The site includes information on Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics that share the progress the company is making towards reaching The Climate Pledge. The new goals, commitments, investments, and programs announced today build on Amazon\u2019s long-term commitment to sustainability through existing innovative programs, including Shipment Zero \u2013 Amazon\u2019s vision to make all shipments net zero carbon, with 50% net zero carbon by 2030; sustainable packaging initiatives like Frustration-Free Packaging and Ship in Own Container, which have reduced packaging waste by 25% since 2015; renewable energy programs; investments in the circular economy with the Closed Loop Fund; and numerous other initiatives happening every day by teams across Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Continues Drive to Shipment Zero \u2013 Announces Early Completion of Goal to Host 50 Solar Rooftop Systems Globally by 2020; Solar Energy Industries Association Ranks Amazon #1 in the U.S. for Amount of Corporate On-site Solar Installed in 2018\nAmazon\u2019s U.S. solar projects have offset the CO2 equivalent of more than 200 million miles of truck deliveries\nGlobally, Amazon has 61 operating solar and wind projects that are expected to generate over 1,044 MW and deliver over 3.1 million MWh of energy annually\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 25, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced the early completion of its commitment to host 50 solar systems on its fulfillment and sortation center rooftops globally by 2020. Additionally, Amazon was ranked #1 in the U.S. for the amount of corporate on-site solar installed in 2018 by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The on-site solar systems reduce Amazon\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, and can generate as much as 80 percent of a single fulfillment facility\u2019s annual energy needs. Amazon\u2019s on-site solar investments support Shipment Zero \u2013 Amazon\u2019s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50% of all shipments net zero by 2030 \u2013 as well as its companywide goal to use 100% renewable energy across its global operations and infrastructure.\nAccording to the SEIA\u2019s 2018 Solar Means Business Report, Amazon ranked #1 in the U.S. for the amount of corporate on-site solar installed in 2018, and #2 for total amount of solar installed to date. And in just the last three-years alone, Amazon has installed more solar capacity in the U.S. than any company. In total, Amazon\u2019s solar projects in the U.S. have offset the CO2 equivalent of more than 200 million miles of truck deliveries.\n\u201cOnline shopping is inherently more sustainable, and with Shipment Zero, we\u2019re working to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50% of all shipments net zero by 2030,\u201d said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability, Amazon. \u201cOur investments in renewable energy \u2013 including reaching our goal of 50 solar rooftop installations a year early \u2013 are another important milestone in building a more sustainable business. Thanks to all the teams working hard to deliver this \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue our investment in renewable energy.\u201d\nGlobally, Amazon has 32 rooftop systems in the U.S., 12 in the EU, and seven in India, totaling over 98 MW of installed capacity. In total, Amazon has 61 operating solar and wind projects that are expected to generate over 1,044 MW and deliver over 3.1 million MWh of energy annually.\n\u201cCorporate solar investments are surging thanks to companies like Amazon,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cOver the past three years, Amazon has installed more solar than any other company, showing that clean energy both boosts the bottom line and helps companies meet climate commitments. We commend Amazon for its leadership on solar energy and urge other businesses to follow their example.\u201d\nAmazon has a longstanding commitment to sustainability. Since launching Frustration-Free Packaging in 2009, Amazon has eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials and avoided 500 million shipping boxes. Amazon continues to invest in sustainability through the company\u2019s network of solar and wind farms, solar on fulfillment center rooftops, the circular economy with the Closed Loop Fund, Amazon\u2019s Second Chance website, and numerous other initiatives happening every day by teams across Amazon. Amazon has also implemented the District Energy Project that uses recycled energy for heating millions of square feet of the company\u2019s headquarters buildings in Seattle. For more information on Amazon\u2019s sustainability initiatives, visit www.amazon.com\/sustainability.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Donates $2 Million to Alliance for Education to Create \"Right Now Needs Fund\" to Help Students in Seattle\nFund will address urgent needs of students in all Seattle Public Schools, with resources targeted to schools with the greatest needs\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2018-- Amazon (Nasdaq:AMZN) today announced a grant to the Alliance for Education to create the \u201cRight Now Needs Fund\u201d to help meet the urgent and basic needs of students attending Seattle Public Schools. This money is meant to be flexible and could be used to purchase a needed raincoat or school supplies, or to provide food in backpacks to feed students over a long weekend.\n\u201cAt least a third of the students in Seattle Public Schools are impacted by poverty, and they are present in all of our 103 schools. The opportunity gap facing children from low income families has been a persistent problem in our community, and it is widening,\u201d said Lisa Chick, President and CEO at the Alliance for Education. \u201cWe are grateful for Amazon\u2019s generosity and understanding that to be successful in education we need to support the basic needs of children. These funds will help us directly address closing the opportunity gap in Seattle.\u201d\n\u201cWe work hard at Aki Kurose to make sure all our kids have what they need to be ready to learn, but the need is far greater than the resources we have available,\u201d said Dr. Mia Williams, Principal at Aki Kurose Middle School. \u201cThis fund puts an incredible tool in our hands to solve problems and set my students up for success. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what this means to my community.\u201d\nLow-income students, including students experiencing homelessness, are concentrated in Seattle\u2019s 31 \u201cTitle 1\u201d schools. However, 18,300 children receive free and reduced lunch across all Seattle Public Schools. Students whose basic needs are not met often struggle to learn.\n\u201cThe Alliance for Education has a track record of administering on-the-ground programs that effectively support success for students and teachers,\u201d said David Zapolsky, Amazon SVP & General Counsel and Alliance for Education board member. \u201cWe worked hard with the Alliance to create a flexible source of funding so each school can quickly decide how to best serve their students.\u201d\nThe Right Now Needs Fund will help principals, teachers, and parents collaborate to remove students\u2019 most basic barriers to learning in all Seattle Public Schools during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years. Spread over the next two years, Amazon will grant to the Alliance for Education to serve as the administrator of the funds for all Seattle Public Schools. The Alliance will disburse the funds to schools according to student needs, and higher poverty schools will receive more support. The only stipulation of the fund is that it must directly benefit students and not replace currently budgeted items.\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired by this city\u2019s strong commitment to public education \u2013 everyone wants our students to succeed. I have also been troubled by the significant challenges many of our students face in their daily lives,\u201d said Seattle Public Schools Superintendent Denise Juneau. \u201cThe Amazon contribution is designed to address those challenges by supporting students\u2019 basic needs and removing barriers to learning. This generous and meaningful support, with the Alliance for Education\u2019s stewardship, will help make sure students can focus on their education. We are so appreciative of this gift to our student community.\u201d\nBoth the Alliance for Education and Amazon are committed to education and addressing urgent needs that prevent students from learning. The Alliance for Education is Seattle\u2019s local education fund, and works in close partnership with Seattle Public Schools and other education stakeholders to create programs and raise funds designed to close opportunity gaps in Seattle\u2019s public school system. Amazon supports STEM and computer science education and programs that address childhood hunger and family homelessness. Amazon is a proud donor to the Families Yes campaign in support of the Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise Levy on the ballot November 6.\n\u201cThese resources will complement existing school funding and help to close the opportunity gap,\u201d said former Seattle Mayor Norman Rice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important than making sure our students are safe, healthy and ready to learn \u2013 I\u2019m delighted that Amazon is making this investment in the future.\u201d\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"4-in-1 Amazon Smart Oven makes cooking simple with voice control and scan-to-cook feature for packaged meals\nNo patience needed: Amazon\u2019s new Certified for Humans program makes it easy to find stress-free smart home devices that are actually smart\nNew Alexa features make everyday tasks easier and help you keep your home safe while you\u2019re away\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 25, 2019-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014Amazon today announced an array of new programs, devices, and features that make it easier than ever for customers to find, setup, and enjoy connected devices in their homes. Amazon is making smart home simpler with Certified for Humans, a new program that helps customers find products that are tested to be simple to setup and work dependably with Alexa, and new devices like the Amazon Smart Oven that make cooking easy. New Alexa Guard capabilities help customers keep their home safe, and new features like WiFi access and easy reordering of household supplies with Alexa make homes even smarter and more convenient.\n\u201cCustomers want their smart home technology to make everyday tasks easier, but not at the expense of spending their whole weekend, or hiring an expert, just to get everything setup,\u201d said Daniel Rausch, Amazon Vice President, Smart Home. \u201cWe think customers will be delighted with what we have coming this fall\u2014more ways to find smart home devices they can set up in minutes, new Alexa features that take the stress out of being away from home, and new products that help families enjoy great meals together or just have a little fun.\u201d\nCertified for Humans (www.amazon.com\/certifiedforhumans) is a new program that helps customers find smart home products that are easy to set up and work seamlessly with Alexa. Every device that carries the Certified for Humans badge offers Frustration Free Setup, which cuts down on the number of steps needed to connect to Alexa. In many cases, it\u2019s as easy as plugging it in. And after that, it only gets better. Certified for Humans devices are tested against over a dozen requirements to help ensure they offer a dependable Alexa experience; no more waiting around for software updates or unresponsive devices. Customers can find the Certified for Humans badge on select smart home devices starting this fall from brands including Amazon, Philips Hue, Hamilton Beach, Kasa Smart by TP-Link, and more.\nNew Smart Home Devices for Convenience and Fun\nAmazon Smart Oven (www.amazon.com\/amazonsmartoven) is a combination convection oven, microwave, air fryer and food warmer. When paired with an Echo, customers can ask Alexa to preheat the oven, start or stop cooking, and be notified when the oven is preheated or their favorite lasagna or fresh-baked cookies are ready. Amazon Smart Oven supports 30 cooking presets and comes with a temperature probe to make it easy to get great, crowd-pleasing cooking results. Customers can also use the convenient scan-to-cook feature to make a great meal, every time. Using the Alexa app or, in the future, a compatible Echo Show device, customers can simply scan the barcode on packaged foods and the Amazon Smart Oven will cook them just right. Scan-to-cook will work with hundreds of packaged foods from brands including Whole Foods Market, 365 Everyday Value, Gardein, Marie Callender\u2019s, and more.\nA new Echo companion device with fun and helpful features for customers of all ages, Echo Glow (www.amazon.com\/echoglow) is a multi-color smart lamp that pairs with Alexa. Just ask for a flickering campfire light for playtime, or a sleep timer that gradually dims as bedtime nears. You can also set Echo Glow to softly cascade through all the colors of the rainbow or, coming soon, ask for a dance party with music and a light show.\nToday customers can choose from more than 85,000 Alexa-compatible products designed for every room and outdoor space around their homes, with new brands and devices being added every week. Later this year, customers can enjoy even more convenient, voice-controlled cooking and small kitchen appliances from top brands including Crock-Pot, GE Appliances, Hamilton Beach, Instant Pot, June Oven, LG, and Whirlpool; new support for garage door openers from beam Home and Nexx; and smart blinds and shades from IKEA, Legrand, Lutron, Schellenberg, and Somfy. Other Alexa-compatible devices coming soon for the home include new products from Procter & Gamble, Dyson, Mr. Christmas, Traeger, and more\u2014all Alexa controlled and designed to make your smart home even smarter.\nMore Convenience and Peace of Mind with New Alexa Features\nWith Alexa Guard, customers can keep their home safe when they\u2019re away. When you set Guard to Away mode, if an Echo device detects the sound of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, or glass breaking, Alexa can send you Smart Alerts, via notifications to your phone. Starting this fall, Guard will begin supporting a new Smart Alert that can notify customers if the sound of activity like footsteps, talking, coughing, or a door closing, is detected while Guard is in Away mode. Customers can also create Alexa Routines that include Guard to provide even more peace of mind and convenience: set Guard to Away mode, lock the back door, and turn on the porch light with a simple phrase like \u201cAlexa, I\u2019m headed out.\u201d And, Amazon will add additional support for Guard integrations with home security systems from Abode and Scout Alarm.\nAlexa will soon make managing WiFi access for family members easier than ever. Instead of unlocking their phone and using an app, customers can use their voice and ask Alexa to pause WiFi access for the family when dinner is ready and unpause access once the dishes are done. Alexa will also help customers manage WiFi access for a single device, or groups of devices, so access for individual family members can be paused quickly and simply. For added convenience, Alexa will also help customers schedule specific WiFi access times, and even turn on or off guest WiFi access with a simple voice command. Alexa customers can use their voice to manage WiFi access on compatible eero, ASUS, Linksys, and TP-Link routers starting this fall.\nLater this year, Alexa will let customers know when supplies used by some of their favorite smart home devices are running low or need to be replaced. For example, Alexa will notify customers when air filters need to be replaced, batteries in a smart lock need to be swapped out, or ink cartridges for a printer are running low. Customers will receive a notification from Alexa when it\u2019s time to reorder, or they can set up smart reordering so that supplies are automatically reordered before they run out.

{"raw_text":"The Amazon Literary Partnership awards more than in funding to 66 nonprofits dedicated to serving writers and announces a new Poetry Fund in collaboration with the Academy of American Poets and a Literary Magazine Fund with the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses\nSince 2009, the Amazon Literary Partnership has awarded more than in grant funding to more than 150 literary organizations\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 20, 2019-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014As part of its decade-long effort to help writers tell their stories and find their readers, the Amazon Literary Partnership today announced over in grant funding to 66 nonprofit literary organizations across the country. The funding will support groups that are working to empower writers, helping them to create, publish, learn, teach, experiment, and thrive.\nSince 2009, the Amazon Literary Partnership has awarded more than in grant funding to more than 150 literary organizations, with a particular focus on supporting a diversity of voices. Grant recipients include nonprofit writing centers, residencies, fellowships, after-school classes, literary magazines, national organizations supporting storytelling and free speech, and internationally acclaimed publishers of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\nThe Amazon Literary Partnership strives to award grants to organizations that have a deep impact on writers\u2019 lives and the broader literary and publishing community.\n\u2022 Over the past five years, organizations supported by the Amazon Literary Partnership have assisted more than 100,000 writers per year, publishing an estimated 3,200 stories and more than 500 books, reaching more than 5 million readers, according to a survey of last year\u2019s grant recipients.\n\u2022 Writers supported by Amazon Literary Partnership grant recipients have won National Book Awards, National Book Critics Circle Awards, MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Grants, National Magazine Awards, and more.\n\u2022 Amazon Literary Partnership\u2019s support for the Academy of American Poets\u2019 \u2018Poem A Day\u2019 series led to the publication of poems by more than 300 poets from diverse backgrounds reaching half a million readers a day via email and online at Poets.org.\n\u2022 Support for National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) helped bring in-school and after-school writing classes to 10,000 schools, reaching 100,000 kids across the US.\nIn addition to the 66 grants gifted this year, the Amazon Literary Partnership has awarded two grants to the Academy of American Poets and the Community of Literary Presses and Magazines (CLMP) to create a new Poetry Fund and Literary Magazine Fund for poetry organizations and literary magazines. Both funds will support more than a dozen organizations and will be announced by the Academy of American Poets and CLMP.\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with the Amazon Literary Partnership to support poetry organizations, especially as poetry in the US is having a heyday with more readers today than in the past fifteen years,\u201d said Jennifer Benka, Executive Director, the Academy of American Poets. \u201cThis boon has been exciting to see, but it's also meant that poetry organizations need more assistance. We appreciate that the Amazon Literary Partnership program was quick to recognize this and respond.\u201d\n\u201cFor over 50 years, CLMP has been dedicated to sustaining the health and extending the reach of the nation\u2019s literary magazines. Often the first places writers find their readers, these publications are essential to the publishing ecosystem, providing fertile ground for diverse voices to thrive,\u201d said Mary Gannon, Executive Director, the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses. \u201cCLMP is honored to lend its expertise to the Amazon Literary Partnership's ongoing financial support of these underserved and uniquely vulnerable publishers.\u201d\n\u201cThe Amazon Literary Partnership\u2019s goal has been to support organizations that are vital to sustaining the literary culture of their communities,\u201d said Neal Thompson, Manager of the Amazon Literary Partnership. \u201cBy funding organizations working to uplift the voices of underrepresented writers, we hope to champion the writers of the world we live in now. We are also thrilled to be working with the Academy of American Poets and CLMP to reach organizations committed to supporting poets and upcoming writers.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s grant recipients include a wide range of organizations striving to amplify diverse voices, including Coffee House Press in Minneapolis, Hugo House in Seattle, and New York-based organizations such as Words Without Borders, Kundiman, Girls Write Now, and The Center for Black Literature. Many of this year\u2019s recipients work on behalf of overlooked or marginalized writers, such as Lambda Literary\u2019s Writers Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Voices in Los Angeles, and workshops for African American writers at the Zora Neale Hurston\/Richard Wright Foundation in Washington, D.C.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be among the organizations to receive support from the Amazon Literary Partnership again this year,\u201d said Karen M. Phillips, Executive Director, Words Without Borders. \u201cThis grant will help us to provide an English-language platform for vital and diverse writers from Oman, the Philippines, Cape Verde, Algeria and elsewhere, engaging readers in a global literary conversation.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon's investment in Lambda Literary's Emerging Writers Retreat ensures that the next generation of LGBTQ writers get the support they need and deserve to bring their vital stories into the world\u201d said Sue Landers, Executive Director of Lambda.\n\u201c5 Under 35 does the crucial work of identifying and elevating major new talent, often introducing a diverse, engaging slate of writers for the first time to a wide audience,\u201d said Lisa Lucas, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. \u201cWithout the generous, ongoing support of the Amazon Literary Partnership, 5 Under 35 simply wouldn\u2019t be possible given the current funding landscape for the literary arts. ALP is fundamental to the work of so many national literary organizations that salute, celebrate, and nurture both readers and writers, which is essential to developing a more diverse literary landscape, strengthening access to books and great writing, and deepening all of our understanding of the world through the lens of literary art.\u201d\nTo learn more about the Amazon Literary Partnership and Amazon in the Community visit https:\/\/www.aboutamazon.com\/our-communities.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Amazon will invest over to provide upskilling training programs for one in three of its employees across the U.S.\nPrograms will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled technical and non-technical roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retail stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon\nBased on a review of its workforce and analysis of U.S. hiring, Amazon\u2019s fastest growing highly skilled jobs over the last five years include data mapping specialist, data scientist, solutions architect and business analyst, as well as logistics coordinator, process improvement manager and transportation specialist within our customer fulfillment network\nEmployee upskilling investment builds on Amazon\u2019s minimum wage and comprehensive benefits including medical insurance, 401k savings plan, and generous parental leave\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 11, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today pledged to upskill 100,000 of its employees across the United States, dedicating over to provide people across its corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retail stores, and transportation network with access to training programs that will help them move into more highly skilled roles within or outside of Amazon.\nAmazon\u2019s Upskilling 2025 pledge invests in a range of new upskilling programs to serve employees from all backgrounds and Amazon locations. Programs include Amazon Technical Academy, which equips non-technical Amazon employees with the essential skills to transition into, and thrive in, software engineering careers; Associate2Tech, which trains fulfillment center associates to move into technical roles regardless of their previous IT experience; Machine Learning University, offering employees with technical backgrounds the opportunity to access machine learning skills via an on-site training program; AmazonCareer Choice, a pre-paid tuition program designed to train fulfillment center associates in high-demand occupations of their choice; Amazon Apprenticeship, a Department of Labor certified program that offers paid intensive classroom training and on-the-job apprenticeships with Amazon; and AWS Training and Certification,which provide employees with courses to build practical AWS Cloud knowledge that is essential to operating in a technical field.\n\u201cThrough our continued investment in local communities in more than 40 states across the country, we have created tens of thousands of jobs in the U.S. in the past year alone,\u201d said Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President, HR. \u201cFor us, creating these opportunities is just the beginning. While many of our employees want to build their careers here, for others it might be a stepping stone to different aspirations. We think it\u2019s important to invest in our employees, and to help them gain new skills and create more professional options for themselves. With this pledge, we\u2019re committing to support 100,000 Amazonians in getting the skills to make the next step in their careers.\u201d\nThe upskilling programs are built by Amazonians, around insights provided by Amazon\u2019s fast-growing workforce \u2013 which will reach 300,000 employees in the U.S. this year \u2013 and experts in the changing jobs landscape. Based on a review of the company\u2019s jobs and analysis of hiring data from its U.S. workforce, Amazon\u2019s fastest growing highly skilled jobs over the last five years are data mapping specialist (832% growth), data scientist (505%), solutions architect (454%), security engineer (229%) and business analyst (160%). Within customer fulfillment, highly skilled roles have increased over 400%, including jobs like logistics coordinator, process improvement manager and transportation specialist within our customer fulfillment network.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there are now more job openings (7.4 million) than there are unemployed Americans (6 million). In looking at job growth over the next decade, the BLS anticipates some of the fastest growing job areas are increasingly in more skilled areas, including medical assistants, statisticians, software developers, nurse practitioners, and wind turbine service technicians. This provides a huge opportunity for individuals who build additional skills to move into better paying jobs. Through its Upskilling 2025 pledge, Amazon is focused on creating pathways to careers in areas that will continue growing in years to come, including healthcare, machine learning, manufacturing, robotics, computer science, cloud computing, and more.\n\u201cThe future of work is now and the challenge is not just adapting to new technologies, but adapting to the dynamism of the economy, which will only accelerate,\u201d said Jason Tyszko, Vice President at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. \u201cAmazon is demonstrating the new role employers must play to counter that challenge, fostering a new relationship with workers where maintaining and growing their skills is an imperative for business success.\u201d\nAs part of Upskilling 2025, Amazon is announcing new training opportunities and building on existing programs for employees across the U.S., including:\n\u2022 Launching Amazon Technical Academy, a training and job placement program that equips non-technical Amazon employees with the essential skills to transition into, and thrive in, software engineering careers. Combining instructor-led, project-based learning with real-world application, graduates of the program master the most widely used software engineering practices and tools required to thrive into a career at Amazon. This tuition-free program was created by Amazon software engineers for Amazon employees who want to move into the field. Find out more here.\n\u2022 Launching Associate2Tech, a program that provides fulfillment center associates the opportunity to move into technical roles, regardless of their previous IT experience, within Amazon\u2019s vast operations network. This fully-paid 90 day program is designed to place associates in on-the-job training for IT support technician roles and pays for their A+ Certification test, a widely recognized certification. No existing degree is needed, and participants have paid study time during their work week. Learn more here\n\u2022 Launching Machine Learning University (MLU), an initiative that helps Amazonians with a background in technology and coding gain skills in Machine Learning. As machine learning plays an increasingly important role in customer innovation, MLU helps employees learn core skills to propel their career growth \u2013 skills that are often taught only in higher education. Divided into six-week modules, the program requires only half to one full day of participation a week. MLU is taught by more than 400 Amazon Machine Learning scientists who are passionate about furthering skills in the field. Originally launched as a small cohort, the program is on course to train thousands of employees.\n\u2022 Growing Career Choice, Amazon\u2019s pre-paid tuition program for fulfillment center associates looking to move into high-demand occupations. Amazon will pay up to 95% of tuition and fees towards a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study, leading to in-demand jobs. Since launching Career Choice in 2012, over 25,000 Amazonians have received training for high-demand occupations including aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, and nursing. The company is investing in expanding the program by building additional classrooms in its fulfillment centers globally, and expects to have over 60 on-site classrooms by the end of 2020.\n\u2022 Expanding Amazon Apprenticeship, a Department of Labor certified program that offers paid intensive classroom training and on-the-job apprenticeships with Amazon. Providing a combination of immersive learning and on-the-job training, the Amazon Apprenticeship program has already created paths to technical jobs for hundreds of candidates working to break into careers including cloud support associate, data technician and software development engineer.\n\u2022 Expanding AWS Training and Certification to close the cloud skills gap in the industry. Amazon employees have access to free classroom and digital training to build cloud knowledge, and discounted AWS Certification exams to validate cloud expertise. Cultivating these in-demand skills opens opportunities both within Amazon and in organizations around the world as demand for cloud talent continues to grow.\nThis pledge furthers Amazon\u2019s commitment to supporting its employees. Last year, Amazon raised its minimum wage to for all U.S. employees, adding to the suite of industry-leading benefits offered by the company, including comprehensive healthcare (medical, dental and vision coverage), up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, 401(k) matching, and more.

The company also receives a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Centralized backup service makes it easier and more cost-effective for customers to automate backups of their data and meet business and regulatory requirements\nState Street Corporation, Smile Brands, and Rackspace among companies using AWS Backup\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced AWS Backup, a fully-managed, centralized backup service that makes it faster and simpler for customers to back up their data across AWS services and on-premises, helping customers more easily meet their business and regulatory backup compliance requirements. AWS Backup makes protecting storage volumes, databases, and file systems easier by giving customers a single service to configure and audit the AWS resources they backup, automate backup scheduling, set retention policies, and monitor recent backups and restores in one place. To get started with AWS Backup visit: aws.amazon.com\/backup.\nAs enterprises move more and more applications to the cloud, their data can become distributed across multiple services, including databases, block storage, object storage, and file systems. While these services in AWS provide backup capabilities, customers often create custom scripts to automate scheduling, enforce retention policies, and consolidate backup activity across several services in order to better meet their business and regulatory compliance requirements. AWS Backup removes the need for custom solutions or manual processes by providing a centralized place to manage backups across AWS. With just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can create a policy that defines how frequently backups are created and how long they are stored. Customers can then assign these policies to their AWS resources, and AWS Backup automatically handles the rest by automatically scheduling backup actions for the assigned AWS resources, orchestrating across AWS services, and managing their retention period.\n\u201cAs the cloud has become the default choice for customers of all sizes, it has attracted two distinct types of builders. Some are tinkerers who want to tweak and fine tune the full range of AWS services into a desired architecture, and other builders are drawn to the same breadth and depth of functionality in AWS, but are willing to trade some of the service granularity to start at a higher abstraction layer, so they can build even faster,\u201d said Bill Vass, VP of Storage, Automation, and Management Services, AWS. \u201cWe designed AWS Backup for this second type of builder who has told us that they want one place to go for backups versus having to do it across multiple, individual services. Today, we are proud to make AWS Backup available with support for block storage volumes, databases, and file systems, and over time, we plan to support additional AWS services.\"\nInitially, AWS Backup is integrated with Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and AWS Storage Gateway, with support for additional services planned for the future. Customers can also back up on-premises application data through the AWS Backup integration with AWS Storage Gateway, providing a common way to protect their on-premises data in the AWS cloud.\nState Street Corporation is the world's leading provider of financial services to institutional investors including investment servicing, investment management and investment research, and trading. \u201cWe operate in the financial services industry and must provide data storage solutions that ensure the integrity and availability of backup data as stipulated by the FFIEC IT examination handbook,\u201d says Nauman Noor, Managing Director, State Street Corporation. \u201cMeeting these regulations requires us to develop and maintain an internal serverless application to enable timely and auditable backups across the AWS services we use. With AWS Backup\u2019s centralized backup console, we will have a single pane of glass to audit our backup processes across our AWS environment, mitigating the need for custom applications and thus, easing our effort to aid data integrity and availability. The ability to set backup policies for automated backup scheduling and backup retention provides us flexibility to address the needs for varying levels of criticality in a cost effective and consistent manner.\u201d\nSmile Brands is a leading dental support organization that provides business support services to over 400 locations across 17 states. \u201cWe manage thousands of AWS resources, such as storage volumes and databases, and all of them must meet compliance according to HIPAA backup requirements,\u201d says George Suda, Senior VP and Chief Information Officer, Smile Brands. \u201cEnsuring that all our AWS workloads are properly backed up can require manual processes and custom scripts. With AWS Backup\u2019s centralized backup console, we will be able to define a backup policy that meets our compliance requirements and apply the same policy to all our AWS resources across the various AWS services that we use. AWS Backup will automatically handle the backup processes on our behalf, providing a full-managed and cost-effective solution that removes the need for manual processes or custom scripts.\u201d\nRackspace delivers modern IT as a service, helping customers in more than 150 countries drive business results with technology. \u201cRackspace is focused on delivering next generation cloud services to help our customers meet their data protection and regulatory compliance needs,\u201d said Prashanth Chandrasekar, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Managed Public Clouds at Rackspace. \u201cWith AWS Backup, we now have access to a cloud-scale, centralized backup solution to help automate, manage, and monitor data protection for customers. We believe AWS Backup will also provide customers greater operational efficiency, allowing us to simplify the process for supporting our customers\u2019 auditing and compliance requirements.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 60 Availability Zones (AZs) within 20 geographic regions, spanning the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and the UK. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"Amazon MSK provides a fully managed, highly available, secure, and compatible service for Apache Kafka\nVonage, Secureworks, Poshmark, Nutmeg, and Compass are among customers and partners using Amazon MSK\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 30, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services Inc., an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon MSK, a fully managed service for Apache Kafka that makes it easy for developers to build and run highly available, secure, and scalable applications based on Apache Kafka without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Amazon MSK is fully compatible with Apache Kafka, enabling customers to easily migrate their on-premises or Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) clusters to Amazon MSK with no code changes. There are no commitments or upfront investment required to run Amazon MSK, and customers only pay for the capacity they use. To get started with Amazon MSK visit https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/msk.\nCustomers use Apache Kafka to capture and analyze real-time data streams from a range of sources, including IoT devices, website clickstreams, financial systems, and database logs. While many customers chose to self-manage their Apache Kafka clusters, they often spend a lot of time and expense securing, scaling, patching, and ensuring high availability for Apache Kafka and Apache ZooKeeper clusters, which Apache Kafka depends on for resource management. Amazon MSK gives customers all of the attributes of Apache Kafka combined with the availability, security, and scalability of AWS. With just a few clicks, customers can create Apache Kafka clusters designed for high availability that span multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Amazon MSK continuously monitors underlying server health, automatically replacing servers when they fail and patching servers in need of updates. Amazon MSK also runs highly available Apache ZooKeeper nodes at no additional cost. Amazon MSK provides multiple levels of security for Apache Kafka clusters, including VPC network isolation, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for AWS Application Programming Interface (API) authorization, encryption at rest, encryption in-transit, TLS based certificate authentication, and authorization using Apache Kafka access control lists (ACLs). Customers can easily scale out cluster storage with a few clicks in the AWS management console to meet changes in demand. Amazon MSK is fully compatible with Apache Kafka, allowing customers to continue to run applications built on Apache Kafka, use Apache Kafka compatible tools and frameworks, and take advantage of new Apache Kafka innovations, without having to change their code.\n\"Customers who are running Apache Kafka have told us they want to spend less time managing infrastructure and more time building applications based on real-time streaming data,\u201d said Rajesh Sheth, General Manager of Amazon MSK, AWS. \u201cAmazon MSK gives these customers the ability to run Apache Kafka without having to worry about managing the underlying hardware, and it gives them an easy way to integrate their Apache Kafka applications with other AWS services. With Amazon MSK, customers can stand up Apache Kafka clusters in minutes instead of weeks, so they can spend more time focusing on the applications that impact their businesses.\u201d\nCustomers start by creating a cluster in Amazon MSK today using the AWS Console or the AWS CLI, and Apache Kafka clients can connect to a cluster using Apache Kafka\u2019s open-source APIs. Amazon MSK is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Paris), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Sydney), and will expand to additional AWS Regions in the coming year.\nVonage is a global business cloud communications leader providing integrated communications solutions that improve how business gets done by enhancing a company\u2019s customer and employee experience. Vonage uses Apache Kafka for real-time communication between various micro-services. \u201cBy using Amazon MSK, we reduced our maintenance overhead and built a micro-services-based platform that enables businesses to collaborate more productively and engage their customers more effectively,\u201d said Venkatesh Ennala, a software engineer with Vonage. \u201cWe can now set up new Kafka clusters more quickly and scale these clusters as our demands increase. Amazon MSK has removed the complexity of set up and maintenance, allowing us to focus on what\u2019s most important - building innovative new capabilities for our customers.\u201d\nSecureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a technology-driven cybersecurity leader that protects organizations in the digitally connected world. \u201cWhen developing and launching our security analytics application, Secureworks chose Amazon MSK service to accelerate time to market and reduce infrastructure and management overhead,\u201d said Wendy Thomas, Senior Vice President of Business and Product Strategy at Secureworks. \u201cThis allowed us to focus on innovation and our unique differentiators, helping protect our customers from cyber threats.\u201d\nPoshmark is a leading social commerce platform for the next generation of retailers and shoppers. \u201cThrough technology, our mission is to build the world\u2019s most connected shopping experience, while empowering people to build thriving retail businesses. Amazon MSK has made it easy to setup, maintain and scale Kafka clusters, enabling an end-to-end data ingestion pipeline supported by a fully-managed service,\u201d said Mahesh Pasupuleti, Senior Director of Data Engineering at Poshmark. \u201cAs our demands increase, we feel confident that we will be able to scale at ease and expand our streaming ingestion pipelines for data enrichment and real-time machine learning, providing an enhanced experience for our customers.\u201d\nNutmeg is Europe\u2019s largest digital wealth manager, helping consumers to grow their wealth and reach their financial goals by using cost effective technology to boost returns. Nutmeg uses Apache Kafka to underpin their journey towards an event driven architecture. \u201cSince adopting Amazon MSK, we\u2019ve been able to significantly increase the efficiency of our teams and reduce time spent maintaining our cluster,\u201d said Matt Gatrell, CTO of Nutmeg. \u201cAs our data requirements and use cases grew, we started to experience considerable overhead and complexity in managing our Kafka clusters. Amazon MSK has allowed us to manage our clusters with confidence, spend less time verifying the performance of the clusters, scale with ease, and focus more time on innovating and building exciting real-time applications.\u201d\nCompass is a real estate technology company with a powerful end-to-end platform that supports the entire buying and selling workflow. Compass uses Apache Kafka to provide its agents with quick access to fresh and accurate data from hundreds of real estate data sources nationwide. \u201cStreaming technology is an important part of what we do as a business, but managing streaming technology involves a lot of heavy lifting by our software developers,\u201d said Joseph Sirosh, CTO of Compass. \u201cAmazon MSK has allowed us to eliminate a lot of this heavy lifting. By using Amazon MSK we no longer need to spend effort on ensuring data durability, cluster availability, and scalability, and can now focus on building applications. Amazon MSK relieves our team from the burden of operating and maintaining Kafka and at the same time, we experience less downtime as our clusters are fully-managed.\u201d\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 66 Availability Zones (AZs) within 21 geographic regions, spanning the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and the UK. Millions of customer\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

The new incentive will fund the startup costs, up to , as well as the equivalent of three months of the former employee\u2019s last gross salary so employees-turned-business-owners can more easily get their package delivery companies off the ground.\n\u201cWe received overwhelming interest from tens of thousands of individuals who applied to be part of the Delivery Service Partner program, including many employees,\u201d said Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from associates that they want to participate in the program but struggled with the transition. Now we have a path for those associates with an appetite for opportunities to own their own businesses.\u201d\nAmazon will take an active role in helping interested employees launch their own package delivery businesses. An employee will leave their role at Amazon to build their business knowing they will have consistent delivery volume from Amazon, access to the company\u2019s sophisticated delivery technology, hands-on training, and discounts on a suite of assets and services, including Amazon-branded vans customized for delivery, branded uniforms and comprehensive insurance.\nAmazon\u2019s new incentive will fund the startup costs, up to , for its employees-turned-small business-owners in the US who want to build their own delivery companies. Amazon will also provide financial support with a payment equal to three months of the former employee\u2019s last gross salary while they build their new package delivery business.\nThis program is the latest example of Amazon initiatives aimed at encouraging employees to develop and advance their careers. Across the US, more than 12,000 people have already taken part in Amazon\u2019s Career Choice program where Amazon pre-pays up to 95% of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, up to , regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon.\nSince the launch of the Delivery Service Partner program in June 2018, Amazon has enabled the creation of more than 200 new small businesses that have hired thousands of local drivers to deliver packages to Amazon customers. This year, the company plans to add hundreds more new businesses, starting with employees-turned-business-owners. Additionally, this program offering has expanded to employees in the UK and Spain. For those interested in starting their own business delivering Amazon packages, visit logistics.amazon.com to learn more.\nThe 2019 Amazon SMB Impact Report revealed there are more than 1.9 million businesses working with Amazon in the U.S. \u2013 selling in our stores, operating a delivery service provider, using Amazon Web Services, running an Alexa Skill, or publishing via Kindle Direct Publishing. Since 2011, Amazon has invested tens of billions to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) succeed, and SMBs have created 1.6 million jobs worldwide to support their sales in Amazon\u2019s stores. The company recently launched Build Your Business with Amazon to help businesses interested in working with Amazon get started.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Canada\u2019s leading news brand delivers new experiences for readers and improves operational efficiencies leveraging AWS machine learning and analytics services\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 14, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that The Globe and Mail, Canada\u2019s most read print\/digital newspaper, has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider and as its standard for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads. Rapid adoption and experimentation with a range of AWS ML services including Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Rekognition, and Amazon Textract have helped reporters and editors at The Globe to more effectively find, tell, and promote stories that matter to their audience without the need for manual review, custom code, or machine learning experience. The Globe also uses Amazon Polly, turning readers into listeners by converting text articles to audio in English, French, and Mandarin, including the newly unveiled Amazon Polly Newscaster voices.\nThe Globe runs applications like its popular recommendation engine and its proprietary Sophi predictive analytics platform on AWS. The Sophi platform uses AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker, to unlock value by learning how readers respond to and engage with content. Using machine learning systems trained by news editors, it can predict how valuable a story is likely to be prior to publication. This helps the team identify which stories should go behind a paywall, as well as which content should be promoted, when, where, and for how long. ML is touching every piece of the newspaper from improving staff efficiency, to creating new experiences for customers, to building new lines of business. The Globe is using Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly, to build models to retain existing customers and acquire new ones.\n\u201cThe Globe and Mail is investing heavily in data science and artificial intelligence. From our new audio feature running on Amazon Polly, to the Sophi predictive analytics platform, we are seeing great value in using AWS\u2019s AI and ML services,\u201d said Greg Doufas, Chief Technology and Digital Officer, The Globe and Mail. \u201cThe Globe originally built Sophi for its own use, but has since begun offering Sophi as a service to other news organizations. With AWS, we are able to bring our tech experts and editorial leadership together to innovate and bring new ideas to the newsroom to provide great experiences for our readers.\u201d\n\u201cThe Globe has been delivering Canada\u2019s news since 1844, and is known for its focus on being a customer-focused organization that puts the needs of its readers first. As a leader in the industry, it is driven by an understanding that it needs to continue to innovate on behalf of their readers and is setting the tone for what\u2019s possible with the world\u2019s leading cloud,\u201d said Eric Gales, Director of Commercial Sales, Amazon Web Services Canada, Inc. \u201cThe Globe is an avid user of many of our AI and ML services, as it continues to provide new experiences for their readers to enjoy the award-winning content produced by their editorial staff.\u201d\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 69 Availability Zones (AZs) within 22 geographic regions, spanning the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Middle East, Singapore, Sweden, and the UK. Millions of customers\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs. To learn more about AWS, visit aws.amazon.com.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Greater Adoption of Digital Tools in Rural America Could Add $140 Billion to the U.S. Economy by 2021\nNew research by U.S. Chamber of Commerce commissioned by Amazon shows that increased adoption of online tools and digital services for businesses across rural America could create more than 360,000 jobs in the next three years\nIncreased adoption could grow annual revenues of rural small businesses by 21% over the next three years \u2013 the equivalent of per year \u2013 with states in the South seeing the greatest benefit\nOnline tools and technology have the highest potential impact on rural small businesses with annual revenue under\nReport outlines recommendations for the private and public sectors, including expanding education and training programs, helping rural areas attract tech talent, and increasing the availability of high-speed internet access and mobile phone connectivity\nWASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 13, 2019-- A new report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commissioned by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has revealed that unlocking the digital potential of rural businesses across the U.S. could add over to the U.S. economy over the next three years and create an additional 360,000 full-time jobs in rural communities.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190313005370\/en\/\nThere are 37 million working-age adults and 18 million households in the rural U.S. While accounting for close to 15% of the adult population and nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s land mass, annual revenues of rural businesses represent only 3.7% of total gross revenues in the U.S. economy. Despite some improvement in the adoption of digital tools by rural businesses over the past years, this new research shows how increased use of digital technology in rural America could help drive faster growth in the rural economy. Greater adoption of digital technology over the next three years could grow revenues of rural businesses by each year (+21.0%), with states in the South realizing the greatest benefit. Online tools and technology have the highest potential impact on rural businesses with revenue under , which could see sales growth surge over 28% over three years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand how rural entrepreneurs can transform their businesses through digital technology, from reaching millions of new customers around the world by selling online, to quickly scaling their startups thanks to affordable access to cloud computing,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO, Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cEnsuring that small businesses in rural America have good digital skills, are able to attract tech talent, and benefit from fast connectivity will deliver increased economic prosperity in rural communities.\u201d\n\u201cThe opportunity to successfully start and grow a rural small business in our country is a great example of how technology is positively transforming nearly every aspect of our lives,\u201d said Tim Day, senior vice president of C_TEC, the Chamber\u2019s Technology Engagement Center. \u201cDigital tools and technologies allow rural small businesses to compete in a global economy\u2014regardless of their size or location\u2014which is essential to a vibrant U.S. economy.\u201d\nAccording to the new research, southern states are among the ones that would benefit the most from increased adoption of online tools and digital services, with rural businesses in West Virginia (+57.6%), Alabama (+32.9%), Mississippi (+32.8%), and Georgia (+31.5%) experiencing some of the largest revenue growths over the next three years. Texas, Ohio, and Mississippi would gain the highest number of new jobs, with the Lone Star state adding an average of 23,400 new jobs per year over the next three years.\nThe report, based on a survey of 5,300 businesses in rural America, outlines a number of recommendations for the public and private sectors to help unlock the unrealized economic potential of rural America, including:\n\u2022 Expand rural business access to digital training and digital tools so they can scale their business. Nearly 41% of respondents agree that policymakers should create programs to incentivize rural businesses to incorporate digital technology into their daily operations.\n\u2022 Increase the talent pipeline of candidates trained in digital skills. 38% of rural small businesses say they can\u2019t hire the talent with the right digital skills in their area.\n\u2022 Increase digital connectivity in rural area. Two-thirds of rural small businesses in America say slow internet or cell phone connectivity has a negative impact on their business.\n\u201cWe have been selling our family-farmed garbanzo beans, peas, lentils, and wheat for five generations, and since joining Amazon we have grown exponentially,\u201d said Sara Mader of Palouse Brands, located in Palouse, WA. \u201cIn addition to growing our sales, Amazon has given our small business in rural Washington the opportunity to hire 15 local employees and reach customers all over the world.\u201d\nOther key findings from the report include:\n\u2022 One-in-five rural businesses are already digital. Nearly 20% of rural small businesses in America generate the vast majority of their revenue (at least 80%) by selling their products and services online.\n\u2022 Technology is boosting rural business revenues. Rural businesses say adoption of digital technologies are important for their future, with 55.2% of them agreeing that e-commerce helps them grow their customer base and a similar percentage (54.6%) confirming that online tools had a positive impact on their revenue in the past three years.\n\u2022 Online services help rural businesses reach customers out of state and overseas. Almost 40% of these small business owners say that digital technology has allowed them to sell beyond their state and 16% of them confirm they are selling internationally due to their access to digital tools. Thirty-three percent sell their products using their own websites, 12.7% use a third-party online sales site, and 35.7% use online marketing, including social media.\n\u2022 Digital tools and technology help purchasing and cut costs. 29% of rural businesses say that online tools reduce purchasing costs of products and materials.\nTo download the full report, including research results and state-specific fact sheets, visit: www.empoweringruralbusinesses.com.\nAbout the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and C_TEC\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world\u2019s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations.

{"raw_text":"One of Africa\u2019s largest lenders selects AWS to accelerate mass migration, drive digital transformation, and enhance security posture in the cloud\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 27, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Standard Bank Group has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider with the intention of migrating its production workloads, including its customer facing platforms and strategic core banking applications to the cloud. Standard Bank Group will leverage AWS services, including data analytics and machine learning, to automate financial operations and enhance customer facing web and mobile applications. The migration to AWS will take place across all business units, subject to approvals from local regulators, including Personal Banking, Wealth, Corporate Investment Banking, and Insurance, driving a more personalized banking and investment experience for customers.\nStandard Bank Group chose AWS because of its broad and deep portfolio of cloud services, overall commitment to security excellence, and strong financial services experience. The South African Reserve Bank also confirmed Standard Bank Group can make the move to AWS while still meeting all current compliance requirements. Standard Bank Group will take advantage of advanced analytics and machine learning services, including Amazon SageMaker, to advance fraud detection and launch new business initiatives, such as machine learning-based advisor capabilities that will help customers make more informed financial decisions. As part of the move, an AWS Cloud Center of Excellence will be established within the bank, featuring a dedicated team focused on facilitating the migration to the cloud and building AWS training and certification programs to up-skill all employees. AWS and Standard Bank Group will also collaborate on building an education and digital skills program, to be launched across Southern Africa, to train the next generation of African cloud experts.\n\u201cOur vision is to be Africa\u2019s leading financial services organization and to achieve this we have chosen to work with the world\u2019s leading cloud,\u201d said Sim Tshabalala, Group CEO of Standard Bank. \u201cFor Standard Bank Group to remain a leader in African financial services, we recognize we need to adopt a cloud-first approach to our business. AWS Cloud technology will create a springboard for Standard Bank Group, helping us to rapidly roll out our digitization and data strategy to better cater to customers whose needs are constantly evolving. The combination of AWS\u2019s rapid agility and high levels of security, combined with Standard Bank\u2019s customer obsession and desire to constantly raise the bar, will allow us to build Africa\u2019s financial services organization of the future and to be positioned as more than a bank.\u201d\n\u201cThe cloud is transforming the financial services industry as organizations look for new ways to enhance customer experiences, and power their entire enterprise operations more efficiently and effectively on the world\u2019s leading cloud,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS. \u201cStandard Bank Group has been a trusted financial institution for more than 150 years. We look forward to working closely with them as they become Africa\u2019s first bank in the cloud, leveraging AWS to innovate new services at a faster clip, maintain operational excellence, and provide secure banking services to customers around the world.\u201d\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 61 Availability Zones (AZs) within 20 geographic regions, spanning the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and the UK. Millions of customers including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"The facility will create more than 700 full-time jobs in Metro Vancouver in 2019\nSEATTLE \u2013 September 27, 2018 \u2013 Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans for a new Lower Mainland fulfillment centre on Tsawwassen First Nation (TFN) lands. The 450,000-square-foot facility will create more than 700 full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits and join Amazon\u2019s network of existing British Columbia facilities in Delta and New Westminster. This will be Amazon\u2019s third fulfillment centre in British Columbia, where it currently employs more than 800 full-time associates. In addition to its fulfillment centres, Amazon employs an additional 1,500 British Columbians at its tech hub in Vancouver.\nIn total, Amazon employs more than 7,000 people working at fulfillment centres, corporate offices, development centres and other facilities throughout Canada in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. Amazon is currently hiring for hundreds of full-time and seasonal positions across the country as the company ramps up for the holiday season. To see available roles and learn more about working at an Amazon fulfillment centre, visit www.amazondelivers.jobs.\n\"Since first opening in British Columbia in 2012, we credit our exciting growth to the incredible customers and outstanding workforce of the Lower Mainland community,\u201d said Glenn Sommerville, Director of Amazon Operations in Canada. \u201cOur ability to create over 700 good-paying jobs with great benefits is thanks to the network of support we\u2019ve received from the Tsawwassen First Nation Executive Council, provincial and community leaders, and strong project partners dedicated to innovation.\u201d\nOnce open, the new facility will be Amazon\u2019s tenth fulfillment facility in Canada and join Amazon\u2019s current fulfillment centres in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario.\n\u201cAmazon is once again choosing British Columbia to create good jobs,\u201d said British Columbia Premier John Horgan. \u201cThis expansion will bring more opportunity for the people of Tsawwassen First Nation and the Lower Mainland. As Amazon does its part to keep B.C. growing, our government is doing its part by opening the doors of opportunity to more people, building the workforce of the future, and making sure our economy works for everyone.\u201d\n Associates at this facility will pick, pack and ship customer items such as books, toys, small electronics and home goods. Full-time employees at Amazon receive competitive hourly wages, medical, vision and dental coverage, a group RRSP plan, stock awards, and performance-based bonuses starting on day one.\n\u201cIt is with great pride that I join the Tsawwassen First Nation and province of British Columbia in welcoming Amazon\u2019s new fulfillment facility,\u201d said Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Public Services, Procurement and Accessibility and Member of Parliament for Delta. \u201cThis expansion project means more than 700 good, well-paying jobs as well as long-term economic growth for our community. Our government is instrumental in promoting Canada\u2019s talented workforce, and today, we celebrate giving Canadians new opportunities to succeed.\u201d\n Amazon also offers employees access to innovative programs like Career Choice, where it will pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, more than 16,000 employees across the globe have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\n \u201cTsawwassen First Nation welcomes Amazon to our Lands,\u201d said Chief Bryce Williams. \u201cThis is a promising advancement that will continue to unlock the potential of TFN as a leading development partner and key economic driver in Metro Vancouver, and we thank our partners GWL Realty Advisors and HOOPP for their roles in bringing this exciting agreement to fruition. For our Members, TFN\u2019s economic development represents reconciliation in action. The investments we\u2019ve made in infrastructure, and the industrial and commercial projects that we\u2019re moving forward, are creating opportunity and contributing to our community\u2019s long-term economic sustainability. Initiatives like Amazon\u2019s Lower Mainland fulfillment facility have the potential to play an important role in a strong, prosperous and united TFN.\u201d\nThe project is being developed by GWL Realty Advisors.\nAbout Amazon\n Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Now customers can connect with multiple satellites at the same time, have nearly continual coverage in mission-critical situations, and lower the cost of getting information from space to Earth\nCustomers can quickly and easily download, process, store, analyze, and act on satellite data faster through integration with Lockheed Martin Verge and a variety of AWS services\nSEATTLE & BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2018-- Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) announced a strategic collaboration to integrate the new AWS Ground Station service with Lockheed Martin\u2019s new Verge antenna network. AWS and Lockheed Martin are bringing these two highly capable systems together to provide a solution that addresses customer needs for resilient satellite uplinks and downlinks. Through this integration, customers using AWS Ground Station gain the ability to download data from multiple satellites at the same time and to continue downloading data even when unplanned outages like a weather event impact parts of the network. And, Lockheed Martin Verge customers benefit from being able to upload satellite commands and data through AWS Ground Station and to quickly download large amounts of data over the high-speed AWS Ground Station network. Both Lockheed Martin Verge and AWS Ground Station customers can now integrate satellite data with the rich portfolio of AWS services, including compute, storage, analytics, and machine learning. To learn more, please visit www.lockheedmartin.com\/Verge and https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ground-station.\nImmediate and continuous access to the latest satellite data is critical in use cases such as public safety, military missions in fast-evolving threat environments, and real-time weather observations for cargo ships and airlines. Today, there are thousands of satellites orbiting the earth and collecting data, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, which are ideal for collecting data for Earth observation and currently comprise about 63 percent of the active satellites now in orbit, according to United Nations data. Traditionally, government organizations or enterprises who have required access to satellite data needed to build or lease ground antennas to communicate with the satellites at significant cost and effort. Further, customers often require antennas in multiple countries and U.S. locations to download data when and where they need it without waiting for the satellite to pass over a desired location. All of this requires significant capital investments and operational costs to build, manage, and maintain antennas, compute infrastructure, and business logic at each antenna location. By combining Lockheed Martin\u2019s distributed network of satellite receivers with direct AWS Ground Station access, the two companies are delivering a next-generation space solution that will help address the growing need for satellite ground communications and data management while reducing capacity constraints and enabling satellite customers to scale their satellite data downlinks in real-time to meet unanticipated demand across a broad variety of situations.\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Lockheed Martin are providing satellite operators increased flexibility, resiliency, and scale in a complete connectivity solution, ground architecture, and cloud environment for integrated satellite and data management operations,\u201d said Rick Ambrose, Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Space. \u201cOur collaboration with AWS allows us to deliver robust ground communications that will unlock new benefits for environmental research, scientific studies, security operations, and real-time news media. In time, with satellites built to take full advantage of the distributed Verge network, AWS and Lockheed Martin expect to see customers develop surprising new capabilities using the service.\u201d\n\u201cAWS and Lockheed Martin have a long, deep relationship and over the past several years it\u2019s become apparent that together we could bring greater capabilities to our public sector and commercial customers,\u201d said Teresa Carlson, Vice President, Worldwide Public Sector for AWS. \u201cToday we are taking the next step in this relationship. The integration of AWS Ground Station with Lockheed Martin Verge brings the unique capabilities of both companies to mutual customers, enabling them to control satellites across both networks and downlink data faster with more resiliency.\u201d\nBecause many AWS Ground Station antennas are co-located with AWS Regions, both AWS and Lockheed Martin customers gain low-latency, local access to other AWS services to process and store this data. For example, they can use Amazon EC2 to control satellites and downlink data, store and share the data in Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Elastic File System, or Amazon S3, use AWS Virtual Private Cloud for secure communications between Amazon EC2 instances and the AWS Ground Station antenna gateway, hunt for real-time business insights with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon EMR, apply machine learning algorithms and models with Amazon SageMaker, add image analysis with Amazon Rekognition, and improve data sets by combining satellite data with IoT sensor data from AWS IoT Greengrass. AWS customers can combine these capabilities to build exciting applications that might use image recognition to identify and protect endangered animals, machine learning to predict faulty construction or industrial systems, or analytics to estimate oil production or assess agriculture yields in real time.\n\u201cAccess to geospatial information gives customers the confidence to make critical decisions. For space startups like Spire Global, AWS and Lockheed Martin are unlocking the potential of nearly continuous and uninterrupted access to satellite data along with the ability to analyze and leverage that data using the broad and deep cloud services available in AWS,\u201d said Robert W. Sproles, Ph.D. and Program Manager, Ground Stations, for Spire Global, Inc. \u201cThe combination of Lockheed Martin Verge and AWS Cloud will allow multiple satellites to downlink simultaneously, which will increase satellite constellation throughput and reduce latency for our customers.\u201d\nCustomers can easily request Lockheed Martin Verge as their preferred downlink directly through the AWS Ground Station console or from the Verge management console. Once Lockheed Martin Verge receives and processes satellite data, customers can access it directly in their virtual private cloud (VPC) in AWS Regions. For AWS customers in the government or regulated industries, this includes the AWS GovCloud and Secret Regions that carry the full range of data classifications, including Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret. Lockheed Martin Verge will be available in private beta today for customers with satellites that support S-band frequencies and can downlink in the Denver, Colorado area. General availability and expansion to the higher frequency X-band will be announced in the future.\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

{"raw_text":"AWS\u2019s unmatched portfolio of cloud services and highly reliable infrastructure enables leading biotechnology company to advance drug pipeline and deliver new treatments to patients\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2018-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Amgen, one of the world\u2019s leading biotechnology companies, is moving the vast majority of its cloud infrastructure to AWS to accelerate innovation, drive cost efficiencies, and unlock new insights from data to help deliver new treatments to patients with serious illnesses. As the company moves more of its technology infrastructure to AWS, it will aim to develop new cloud-based business applications that leverage the breadth and depth of AWS\u2019s services, as well as its unparalleled reliability, agility, and scalability.\nAmgen uses AWS\u2019s breadth of functionality, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning services, to support the development of new applications and to automate processes in the cloud. Amgen has been working with AWS since 2012 to successfully develop several core applications and to support new high-performance computing workloads. For example, Amgen deployed high performance computing platforms at scale on AWS to support Clinical Pharmacology modeling and simulation and to enable scientists in R&D to search, explore, and run advanced analytics. Additionally, Amgen created an Enterprise Data Lake on AWS using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, as well as other technologies to analyze data and optimize drug manufacturing processes. The success of this initiative led Amgen to break ground in other business areas, such as analyzing sales data to better understand how its salesforce is performing in the field and patient population data analytics to shape clinical trial design.\n\u201cAt Amgen, we hire top technologists who work closely with scientists and other experts to bring new breakthrough medicines to market,\u201d said Mike Zahigian, Chief Information Officer at Amgen. \u201cWe see our expanded relationship with AWS as an important enabler to advance our overall Information Systems Strategy. The choice to go in this direction was influenced in no small part by technologists in information systems rapidly adopting AWS technologies over the last few years to accelerate innovation. We see increased use of AWS facilitating our ability to scale our business at a faster pace and deliver innovative applications that contribute to our mission to serve patients.\u201d\n\u201cBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like Amgen are turning to the cloud to better leverage the vast amounts of clinical data available, unlocking deeper insights faster to help medical professionals treat their patients,\u201d said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. \u201cAs a market leader, Amgen is rapidly adopting the most advanced AWS services\u2014including our machine learning and analytics technologies\u2014to develop innovative medicines and deliver solutions for grievous illnesses. We look forward to working with Amgen as they expand their use of AWS to evolve their business in the cloud.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 125 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 57 Availability Zones (AZs) within 19 geographic regions around the world, spanning the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the UK.

{"raw_text":"Creator of Fortnite, the multiplayer battle royale game that has become a global phenomenon, relies on AWS for its expansive infrastructure, unmatched reliability, and global scale\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 17, 2018-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that video game and software development corporation Epic Games, creator of the blockbuster cross-platform game Fortnite,is continuing to invest in AWS as its choice in infrastructure\u2014going all-in on the world\u2019s leading cloud\u2014to build new games and enhance the in-game experiences for its more than a hundred million online players around the globe. Since its inception, Fortnite has been powered by AWS, leveraging AWS\u2019s unmatched performance and scalability to support the millions of concurrent players that engage each day. The leading game developer runs its worldwide game server fleet, backend platform systems, databases, and websites on AWS, and will leverage the breadth and depth of AWS\u2019s services, including analytics, machine learning, and containers, to continually improve gameplay.\nAWS\u2019s fault-tolerant, highly performant infrastructure enables Epic Games to reliably support more than 125 million players worldwide who flock to Fortnite to win a Victory Royale. By using AWS, Epic Games is able to scale up to meet the demands of these players and expand its services globally with minimal effort. For example, Epic Games recently ran an event on AWS where the company invited all Fortnite players to join the game and watch a one-time global event that lasted for only several minutes. The event generated a rush of players into the game that was unprecedented for Epic Games, and the capacity that AWS provided enabled the company to run that event without any serious problems, ensuring game servers were available to all who wanted to participate. In addition, Epic Games is using AWS analytics services such as Amazon Kinesis Streams and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) to ingest and analyze the billions of events generated by the game and social media interaction so that the company can assess design decisions, identify player sentiment, and adjust key elements of the game. Epic Games will also be able to simplify the management of its infrastructure during peak times using Amazon Elastic Container Services for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS), and is looking to leverage the Amazon ML Solutions Lab to incorporate machine learning into its games.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been developing our services on AWS since 2012. AWS has the broadest and deepest portfolio of services that allow us to stay focused on driving innovation in our products rather than the basic infrastructure needed to get or keep a service running. Their unmatched scalability has been instrumental in keeping pace with our rocketing player populations,\u201d said Chris Dyl, Director of Platform at Epic Games. \u201cWe decided to go all-in using AWS because they enable us to offer a quality gaming experience to millions of gamers around the world, simultaneously. We are excited to work with AWS to expand our use of analytics, machine learning, and containerized applications using Kubernetes to make our sizable infrastructure even easier to maintain.\u201d\n\u201cFortnite\u2019s meteoric rise is a quintessential example of how embracing the cloud and utilizing it fully can significantly impact the trajectory of your business,\u201d said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. \u201cThroughout Fortnite\u2019s phenomenal growth trajectory, Epic Games has relied upon AWS to provide gamers with the best gaming experience in the world, and to speed innovation by delivering new items, features, and play modes to the game on a regular basis. Together, we look forward to driving new player experiences, leveraging AWS analytics and machine learning services.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 125 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 55 Availability Zones (AZs) within 18 geographic regions and one Local Region around the world, spanning the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the UK. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"Mass migration to AWS enables Guardian to reduce its data center footprint as it drives business transformation, operational efficiency, and innovation in the cloud\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 28, 2018-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (Guardian) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider, and is moving the majority of its workloads to AWS for greater agility, reliability, and functionality. The 158-year-old mutual insurance company continues to migrate production workloads to AWS, including mission-critical functions such as data analytics platforms, customer portals, and direct-to-consumer services, and is closing its Guardian owned and operated data centers. By moving to AWS, Guardian has reduced its IT operating costs and is using AWS for its acquisition strategy, migrating newly acquired businesses to the cloud to shed legacy infrastructure and technical debt.\nGuardian took a deliberate approach to its cloud migration, moving targeted production workloads to AWS first. The organization then worked with AWS to create an enterprise readiness program that would allow for a smooth transition from on-premises to the cloud, and provide a training facility for employees to develop advanced digital capabilities faster than ever before. AWS delivered hands-on support and dedicated resources who were deeply steeped in industry-specific challenges, and helped to establish Guardian\u2019s best practices for security in the cloud. The success of these initial migrations to AWS and the ability to train its workforce using this program gave Guardian the confidence necessary to accelerate its move to the world\u2019s leading cloud. Guardian now relies on AWS\u2019s fault-tolerant, secure infrastructure, and is prototyping and developing new applications using AWS\u2019s breadth of functionality, including compute, database, analytics, and machine learning services. Guardian built a data lake on AWS and Amazon EMR to support its anticipated data growth and analytics strategy. Additionally, Guardian is actively evaluating Amazon SageMaker\u2014a fully-managed machine learning service\u2014to gain insights into critical business functions such as customer analytics, and fraud detection.\n\u201cAWS has helped Guardian get ahead of insurance industry disruption driven by new technology and changing customer expectations, and enabled us to innovate and provide services how, when and where our customers prefer,\u201d said Dean Del Vecchio, Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer, and Head of Enterprise Shared Services at Guardian. \u201cAWS\u2019s reliable, secure and proven infrastructure lets us scale quickly and access industry-leading services to test and deploy new technologies that delight our customers while protecting our assets in the cloud.\u201d\n\u201cCompanies across the financial services industry, like Guardian, are turning to AWS for the reliability, functionality, scalability, and security that often exceed the capabilities of on-premises data centers,\u201d said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. \u201cGuardian has been a trusted insurance company for more than 150 years, withstanding the test of time and embracing new technological advances to provide services that deliver financial confidence to customers. We look forward to continuing our work with Guardian as they move to AWS, closing the last of their data centers by the end of this year and looking ahead at ways they can leverage our services, including machine learning and analytics, to continue to evolve their business.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 125 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 57 Availability Zones (AZs) within 19 geographic regions around the world, spanning the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the UK. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25, 2018 \/PRNewswire\/ -- DREAMFORCE 2018 -- Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS),an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today expanded their global strategic alliance announcing new product integrations that will dramatically simplify how customers can securely share and synchronize data across AWS and Salesforce services.The new capabilities will demonstrate the companies' continued investment in delivering deeper levels of integration between AWS and the Salesforce Lightning Platform.\nAs part of the next phase of their global strategic alliance, AWS and Salesforce will deliver the following integrations and a highly secure, trusted framework for connecting the Salesforce Platform with AWS PrivateLink and Amazon Connect:\n\u2022 AWS PrivateLink integration with Salesforce APIs: AWS PrivateLink will allow SaaS application developers who build on AWS to offer private endpoints as an additional option for accessing their service. This integration will provide endpoints for core Salesforce APIs within the developers' Amazon VPCs and vice versa. Exposure to Internet threats is reduced by using a dedicated AWS network connection, which privately routes all traffic flowing between Salesforce and AWS services on a dedicated Amazon network connection rather than the public Internet. Customers will be able to use their PrivateLink-enabled Salesforce endpoints to do more with their customer data, from big data analytics to machine learning, making it significantly easier to unlock customer insights than what is currently possible with custom, one-off integration points.\n\u2022 AWS integration with Salesforce Platform Events: Building intelligent, connected customer experiences requires complex synchronization of data between systems. Customers are increasingly building event-driven architectures that trigger processes in AWS based on data changes in Salesforce, and vice versa. As part of this announcement AWS and Salesforce will collaborate on a new solution that will enable mutual customers to publish and subscribe to Salesforce Platform Events in AWS with unprecedented ease. Events in Salesforce, such as the creation of a sales opportunity, can then easily trigger actions in AWS Lambda and other AWS products. Once processing is complete, results will publish back to Salesforce as Platform Events. For example, enterprises who are managing fleets of connected devices on AWS would be able to leverage usage data to alert sales, service, and marketing teams who are using Salesforce so they can proactively resolve customer incidents, generate sales leads, and cross-sell new services. AWS integration with Salesforce Platform Events will be available in 2019.\n\u2022 Integration with Amazon Connect for Salesforce Service Cloud: Today, companies can leverage Amazon Connect, a self-service, cloud-based contact center service, together with Salesforce Service Cloud to deliver capabilities that support customer workflows between three of the most critical contact center technologies \u2014 interactive voice response (IVR), automatic call distributor (ACD), and CRM. Expanding on this integration, Amazon Connect for Salesforce Service Cloud will enable customers to build highly dynamic, AI-driven, self-service voice experiences with a Lightning-integrated agent and customer community. This may include prebuilt data and omni-channel integration, support for bots, and artificial intelligence (AI) built with Amazon Lex and Salesforce Einstein. Amazon Connect for Salesforce Service Cloud is now available and mutual customers can install the .\nSalesforce today runs the vast majority of their public cloud workloads on AWS. Salesforce is now live on AWS in Australia and Canada, and customers can access the Salesforce Customer Success Platform on the AWS Canada (Central) Region and AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, Salesforce's first international infrastructure expansions supported with AWS cloud services. With strong customer momentum across both countries, Salesforce is set to further accelerate its growth in both countries with new locally-based instances as an option for its core services.In addition, many Salesforce services, including Heroku, Quip and Marketing Cloud Social Studio, also run on AWS infrastructure.\n\"Salesforce's growing strategic relationship with AWS is fueled by a shared commitment to customer success,\" said Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer, Salesforce. \"Our newest integrations will empower CIOs to securely share and synchronize data across two of the world's most trusted cloud platforms to accelerate their digital transformation.\"\n\"Because of the deep relationship between AWS and Salesforce \u2013 Salesforce runs the vast majority of their public cloud workloads in AWS, and Amazon relies upon Salesforce across various businesses to enhance customer relationships - we have a unique ability to integrate our services and provide customers with enhanced solutions,\" said Matt Garman, Vice President, AWS Compute Services. \"These new integrations will enable companies to leverage the full power of both platforms, driving innovation and building intelligent, connected customer experiences.\"\nIntuit Inc. is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting, and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, accountants, and individuals. \"With the seamless integration between Amazon Connect and Salesforce, we're unleashing the power of technology to customize the agent experience through data,\" said Loren Lacy, Group Product Manager, Customer Success and Sales Technology, Intuit Inc. \"We're improving productivity and allowing them to focus on customers, not their tools, to provide the best possible customer experience.\"\nAutodesk, a leading software developer for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries relies extensively on Salesforce to manage their customer experience and account based selling and marketing. \"The integration of Salesforce with cloud services from AWS helps us know our customers better. We are excited about new integrations that will empower our teams who interact with customers with the information they need, when they need it\", says Tzvetana Duffy, Director of Data and Automation at Autodesk.\"\n\u2022 Learn more about the Amazon and Salesforce partnership:\nSalesforce, the global CRM leader, empowers companies to connect with their customers in a whole new way.

{"raw_text":"Santander Group's 100 percent digital bank now powered by the world\u2019s leading cloud\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 28, 2018-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Openbank, a subsidiary of Santander Group, runs on the world\u2019s leading cloud for the most reliable infrastructure and the ability to innovate quickly and more frequently on behalf of its 1.3 million customers in Spain. The digital bank will run production workloads on AWS, including its website, mobile application, and core banking system. Openbank plans to expand internationally using AWS\u2019s global infrastructure to increase redundancy and fault tolerance by replicating key systems across geographic regions.\nOpenbank chose AWS for its operational expertise, breadth of functionality, commitment to security, and understanding of the financial services industry, enabling the bank to innovate its business in the cloud. Openbank worked with AWS to migrate its mission-critical data lake from on-premises to a cloud-based architecture. The data lake now uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Lambda, and Amazon Athena for a more flexible environment that empowers Openbank data scientists and engineers to harness and analyze customer data so that they can make better informed decisions faster. In addition, Openbank leveraged Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to create a web and mobile front-end application that supports digital interactions with bank customers such as performing credit risk analysis, requesting new loans, and recommending investment strategies.\n\u201cAWS enabled us to launch a secure and reliable digital bank in a multinational environment, complying with European regulation in record time,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Miralles, Chief Technology and Operating Officer at Openbank. \u201cWe are using the most comprehensive set of cloud services to evolve our customer service models, and help us meet the rigorous requirements of stakeholders and regulators who need transparency into and proof of robust security architectures that protect both our customers and proprietary data. We plan to leverage AWS\u2019s advanced machine learning technologies like Amazon SageMaker to automate tasks related to financial operations and use more analytics capabilities to gain deeper insights into what our customers desire most.\u201d\n\u201cEntrepreneurial-minded financial services organizations like Openbank are creating entirely new market segments on AWS,\u201d said Mike Clayville, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at AWS. \u201cSantander\u2019s Openbank collaborated with our industry experts to reassess their operating models, build anew, and implement strategies to accelerate product development, delivery, and upgrades in the cloud\u2014all without compromising security and compliance. They are using AWS\u2019s analytics services, big data capabilities, and machine learning services to make decision-making a science, rather than a guessing game, which has already had a major impact on the bank\u2019s plans for long-term growth and expansion.\u201d\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 125 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 57 Availability Zones (AZs) within 19 geographic regions around the world, spanning the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the UK. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

Businesses of all sizes and across virtually every industry and geography are running their SAP landscapes, including multiple production environments, on AWS to simplify infrastructure management, improve time-to-market, lower costs, and deliver innovation with AWS services integration.\nAWS has been working with SAP since 2011 to enable customers to deploy and migrate their SAP applications to AWS, and has certified AWS for the vast majority of SAP applications available to customers today. In addition, AWS is working with SAP to power multiple SaaS services and offerings including SAP Concur, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Platform (SCP), and HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC).\n\u201cCustomers have been relying on AWS to run their mission-critical SAP applications in a secure and optimized way for years, driving significant performance increases and lowering costs,\u201d said Terry Wise, Vice President, Worldwide Partner Ecosystem, AWS. \u201cNow, we are seeing customers integrate their SAP solutions with AWS\u2019s unmatched capabilities in compute, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, serverless computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and more to create innovative and differentiated offerings.\u201d\nCompass Group, Illumina, AGC Asahi Glass Co., Petronas Lubricants, Sumitomo Chemical, Visy, Mitsui & Co., Cardinal Health, Bose, Louisiana Pacific, Citco, Thermo Fisher, Contact Energy, Mercury, Del Monte, L&T Infotech, Edelweiss General Insurance, Oppo Electronics, Videocon, and BR Distribuidora are just a few of the customers running SAP solutions on AWS.\nCompass Group, better known for its brands including Bon Appetit, Eurest, Canteen, Wolfgang Puck, among others, is one of the world\u2019s largest foodservice companies, serving millions of people daily and employing over 500,000 associates across all continents. Compass Group relies on SAP to run their business, from supply chain and financials to payroll. \u201cBy moving SAP to AWS, Compass has been able to provide a global network between its global offices by sharing data and applications in a cost effective way via the cloud. This has enabled disaster recovery systems at a local and regional level and ultimately allowed Compass to innovate faster by leveraging the scale, maturity, security, and reliability of AWS,\u201d said Imran Ali, CTO Compass Group.\nIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. Their focus on innovation has established them as the global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, serving customers in the research, clinical, and applied markets. \u201cBy selecting AWS for our SAP HANA Analytics environment, we are now able to meet the growth and agility needs of our business, along with providing a secure, durable, and highly available platform to our customers,\u201d said Norm Fjeldheim, CIO at Ilumina. \u201cSince deploying on AWS, we can now build and scale SAP environments in a matter of minutes, a previous constraint of ours. SAP HANA Analytics on AWS now acts as our core Data Mart, empowering our business to capture endless data sources, ultimately leading to faster decision making.\u201d\nEstablished in 2008, Petronas Lubricants International manufactures and markets a full range of high-quality automotive and industrial lubricant products in over 100 markets globally. \u201cAt Petronas Lubricants International, technology is at the heart of our business. We invest in technology to serve our customers better and ensure business growth and sustainability. Our global implementation of SAP S\/4HANA on AWS replaces nine legacy systems and integrates our in-country deployments to a globally managed solution. With AWS, our infrastructure set-up for SAP S\/4HANA accelerated from three months to less than two weeks. This has enabled us to focus on design and innovations to meet business needs at a 50 percent lower equivalent on-premises infrastructure cost,\u201d said Yew Cheong Chow, CIO, Petronas Lubricants International.\nSumitomo Chemical is a major Japanese chemical company founded in 1913 as a fertilizer manufacturing plant. \u201cAfter migrating our Japanese SAP ERP instance to AWS, it ran much faster than our on-premises environment. Job-processing time reduced by approximately 40 percent. Overall, the results far exceeded our expectations. Migrating to AWS also let us implement disaster-recovery solutions, which had been difficult with our on-premises environment. The work an IT department does changes with the times, and engineers need to change with it. My impression is that as we use AWS more widely, the members of our IT department are starting to think differently too,\u201d said Yasuo Tosa Associate Officer, IT Innovation Dept., Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.\nVisy is a leading packaging and recycling company with more than 120 locations across Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand. The company, which has a workforce of more than 5,500 employees, also has trading offices across Asia, Europe, and North America. Visy sought to migrate all the systems running on its private cloud\u2014including SAP\u2014to a public cloud environment to improve performance. \u201cSAP is the core financial system for our entire global operation. We saw the switch to a public cloud as an opportunity to improve our SAP performance\u2014ensuring financial data got to stakeholders faster than ever before for better business decisions,\u201d said David Peano Chief Information Officer, Visy. \u201cWe wanted to work with a cloud provider that could help us incorporate AI and IoT technologies into our business. By moving to AWS, response times on the SAP database are 28 percent faster than in our private cloud infrastructure. We\u2019re also seeing a 46 percent boost in performance on the application server level.\u201d\nMitsui & Co. (Australia) Ltd. is the wholly owned Australian subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., one of the world's most diversified trading, investment, and services enterprises, and leading exporter of Australia\u2019s key natural resources and agricultural commodities. \u201cWith our previous, on-premises financial reporting system, uptimes were about 85 percent. Using AWS, we get uptimes of 99.99 percent for SAP S\/4 HANA. Ultimately, AWS was more cost-competitive than the other cloud-service providers we evaluated. Plus, with AWS Availability Zones present in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, we could keep our data securely stored and backed up in Australia. The scalability of the SAP S\/4 HANA platform on AWS enables us to bring the benefits of SAP to other business units without the cost of implementing a new system,\u201d said Craig Howard, General Manager of Finance, Mitsui Coal Holdings.\nTo learn more about running SAP on AWS, visit http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sap.\nFor over 12 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

{"raw_text":"Amazon funding Amazon Future Engineer Robotics grants \u2013 including access to computer science education, FIRST robotics program registrations to start a robotics team, and a tour of a local Amazon robotics fulfillment center for up to 30 Seattle Public Schools\nBeginning this fall, Seattle Public Schools join 100 schools across 22 states set to benefit and support the future generation of innovators\nAmazon Future Engineer is a four-part, childhood-to-career program that works to inspire and educate 10 million children and young adults each year from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science and coding\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 25, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Seattle Public Schools today announced a new partnership to bring computer science and robotics to up to 30 Title 1 Seattle Public Schools as part of the Amazon Future Engineer program. Amazon is providing each of the schools with an Amazon Future Engineer Robotics grant to inspire the next generation of computer scientists, with a focus on students from underrepresented and underserved communities. Each of the schools will receive support to launch FIRST robotics teams, including teacher professional development to learn about robotics, support from Amazon to expand access to computer science education in their school, and a private tour of an Amazon robotics fulfillment center in Kent, Washington.\nThe mission of FIRST, curriculum provider for Amazon Future Engineer Robotics grants, is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills to students in grades K-12. Data from a 5-year longitudinal study of FIRST by Brandeis University shows competitive FIRST robotics programs works for all youth. Across all demographic groups (gender, race, economic status and geography), FIRST students show significant gains in STEM knowledge, STEM interest, STEM career interest, STEM identity, and STEM activity compared to their peers who don\u2019t participate. FIRST students are more likely to major in tech-focused science fields in college; by their second year of college, over 50 percent declare majors in engineering or technology. The impact on young women in FIRST is particularly profound. By their first year of college, female alumnae of FIRST are 3.6 times more likely to take an engineering course, and 1.9 times more likely to take a computer science course than female comparison students.\nSeattle Public Schools is committed to creating opportunities for students who have historically been the furthest from educational justice; these students have also been underrepresented in STEM careers. They recognize the positive impact the partnership will have on educators, teachers and coaches to learn new skills and new ways of applying standards-based teaching in a new environment.\n\u201cThis partnership with Amazon will give our students of color the opportunity to see engineers who look like them \u2013 which provides a huge benefit and creates a quicker course to students imagining a future in a STEM field,\u201d said Seattle Public Schools Superintendent Denise Juneau. \u201cCreating educational journeys like these help ensure our students are prepared for college, career, and life.\u201d\n\u201cSeattle is our hometown, and it\u2019s very important to us to make sure more students in our city, especially those from underserved and underrepresented communities have access to an exciting and rewarding computer science education,\u201d said Beth Galetti, Amazon Senior Vice President of Human Resources. \u201cWe are excited to help Seattle Public Schools students become the innovators of the future, and we\u2019re confident that this hands-on experience provided by Amazon Future Engineer will be both fun and informative.\u201d\n\"Amazon is helping FIRST in our goal to make robotics teams and programs available in every school,\u201d said Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST and president of DEKA Research & Development. \u201cIn FIRST, every kid on every team can go pro. They gain a hands-on learning pathway in technology, computer science and engineering that propels them forward and inspires innovation.\"\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a tiny minority from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\nMore locally, the Washington Business Roundtable has reported that a large number of hundreds of thousands new jobs being generated in the Seattle area will be STEM-related. Moreover, the Puget Sound Business Journal stated in their January 6, 2016 edition that Washington isn\u2019t producing enough qualified workers to supply talent-starved tech companies.\nLaunched in November, 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer aims to inspire more than 10 million kids to explore computer science; provide over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; award 100 students with four-year scholarships, as well as offer guaranteed and paid Amazon internships to gain work experience. Amazon Future Engineer is part of Amazon\u2019s investment in computer science\/STEM education. In addition, Amazon Future Engineer has donated more than to organizations that promote computer science\/STEM education across the country.\nSchools currently confirmed to participate are as follows:\nAbout Amazon in the Community\nAmazon is committed to helping all children and young adults, especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities, have the resources and skills they need to build their best future. Amazon focuses on building long-term, innovative, and high impact programs that leverage Amazon\u2019s unique assets and culture. Initiatives include Amazon Future Engineer, designed to inspire and excite 10 million children and young adults from underrepresented communities each year to pursue an education in computer science, as well as programs that support immediate needs, including fighting childhood hunger by providing access to millions of breakfasts through its nationwide Rise and Smile program, addressing family homelessness through donations and housing a homeless shelter in its Seattle headquarters, and global relief efforts for people in need following natural disasters.\nSeattle Public Schools is committed to eliminating opportunity gaps for students furthest from educational justice and providing a high-quality, world-class education for each of the nearly 53,000 students served. As part of its 2019-24 district strategic plan, the district is committed to building out new career and technical education (CTE) course pathways in STEM-related areas as a way of helping these students develop college and career readiness.\nAccomplished inventor Dean Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in 1989 to inspire an appreciation of science and technology in young people. Based in Manchester, N.H., FIRST designs accessible, innovative programs to build self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills while motivating young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, and engineering.

{"raw_text":"Three new wind farms in Ireland, Sweden, and the United States will produce more than 670,000 MWh annually and support AWS\u2019s goal to power 100% of its global infrastructure with renewable energy\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 8, 2019-- Today, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced three new renewable energy projects as part of its long-term goal to power all Amazon Web Services (AWS) global infrastructure with renewable energy. These projects \u2013 one in Ireland, one in Sweden, and one in the United States \u2013 will deliver wind-generated energy that will total over 229 megawatts (MW) of power, with expected generation of over 670,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually. The new projects are part of AWS\u2019s long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy for its global infrastructure. In 2018, AWS exceeded 50 percent renewable energy for its global infrastructure. For more information, go to https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/about-aws\/sustainability\/.\nOnce complete, these projects, combined with AWS\u2019s previous nine renewable energy projects, are expected to generate more than 2,700,000 MWh of renewable energy annually \u2013 equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of over 262,000 US homes, which is approximately the size of the city of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\u201cEach of these projects brings us closer to our long-term commitment to use 100 percent renewable energy to power our global AWS infrastructure,\u201d said Peter DeSantis, Vice President of Global Infrastructure and Customer Support, Amazon Web Services. \u201cThese projects are well-positioned to serve AWS data centers in Ireland, Sweden, and the US. We expect more projects in 2019 as we continue toward our goal of powering all AWS global infrastructure with renewable energy.\u201d\nAmazon has committed to buying the energy from a new wind project in Ireland, a 91.2 MW wind farm in Donegal. The Donegal wind farm project is expected to deliver clean energy no later than the end of 2021.\n\u201cAWS\u2019s investment in renewable projects in Ireland illustrates their continued commitment to adding clean energy to the grid and it will make a positive contribution to Ireland\u2019s renewable energy goals,\u201d said Leo Varadkar, An Taoiseach of Ireland. \u201cAs a significant employer in Ireland, it is very encouraging to see Amazon taking a lead on this issue. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon as we strive to make Ireland a leader on renewable energy.\u201d\nAmazon will also purchase 91 MW of power from a new wind farm in B\u00e4ckhammar, Sweden, which is expected to deliver renewable energy by the end of 2020.\n\u201cSweden has long been known for ambitious renewable energy goals, and this new wind farm showcases both our country\u2019s leadership and AWS\u2019s commitment to renewable energy,\u201d said Anders Ygeman, Sweden\u2019s Minister for Energy and Digital Development. \u201cThis is a significant step in Sweden\u2019s renewable energy production as we work toward our target of 100 percent renewable energy by 2040.\u201d\nCalifornia leads the United States in renewable electricity generation from non-hydroelectric sources, and the state\u2019s Tehachapi Mountains, where AWS\u2019s wind farm will be located, contain some of the largest wind farms in the country. The wind farm project in Tehachapi is expected to bring up to 47 MW of new renewable energy capacity by the end of 2020.\n\u201cThis announcement from AWS is great news, not just for California, but for the entire country, as it reaffirms our role as a leader in renewable energy and allows us to take an important step forward on deploying the clean energy we need to respond to climate change,\u201d said California State Senator Jerry Hill, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications.\nBeyond the sustainability initiatives focused on powering the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon recently announced Shipment Zero, which is Amazon\u2019s vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50 percent of all shipments net zero by 2030. Additional sustainability programs across the company include Amazon Wind Farm Texas, which adds more than 1 million MWh of clean energy each year. In total, Amazon has enabled 53 wind and solar projects worldwide, which produce more than 1,016 MW and are expected to deliver over 3,075,636 million MWh of energy annually. These projects support hundreds of jobs, while providing tens of millions of dollars of investment in local communities. Amazon has also set a goal to host solar energy systems at 50 fulfillment centers by 2020.

View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190402005419\/en\/\n\u201cThis scholarship is very important because it means when I go to college, I won\u2019t have to constantly worry about money,\u201d said Leo Jean Baptiste, from Orange High School in Orange, New Jersey. \u201cI have an internship at one of the top companies in the world \u2013 I feel relieved knowing that I have the opportunity set up ahead of time.\u201d\n\u201cLeo is going to be a brilliant computer scientist and, more than that, he wants to use computer science to really make a change and better the world,\u201d said Hooman Behzadpo, Leo\u2019s math and computer science teacher at Orange High School. \u201cThis is a phenomenal opportunity for Leo, and it\u2019s a phenomenal thing for the community. But equally as much, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for future generations of students.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a huge help for all of these students about to start college,\u201d said senior House Education Committee Member Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC). \u201cAs a former professor, I know higher education is becoming increasingly expensive, and it\u2019s so important for students who need extra financial support to get that, especially if it helps them pursue a promising, rewarding, and in-demand field of study like computer science.\u201d\n\u201cWe are confident that these scholarship recipients are our country\u2019s next generation of world-changing inventors and leaders. They are an impressive, hard-working group, and we\u2019re thrilled to call them our first class of Amazon Future Engineer scholarship winners,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO, Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cThis scholarship is a reflection of our appreciation for the work these students have done so far, and an investment in them and the future we all share. We are eager to see the bold paths paved by these students as college students, Amazon interns, and beyond.\u201d\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a small number from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\nLaunched in November, 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer aims to inspire more than 10 million kids to explore computer science; provide over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; award 100 students with four-year scholarships, as well as offer guaranteed and paid Amazon internships to gain work experience. Amazon Future Engineer is part of Amazon\u2019s investment in computer science\/STEM education. In addition, Amazon Future Engineer has donated more than to organizations that promote computer science\/STEM education across the country.\nRising high school seniors can apply for the Amazon Future Engineer scholarship starting in November, 2019. Requirements for the Amazon Future Engineer scholarship include: completion of an Advanced Placement Computer Science course in high school, intent to pursue a computer science degree at a four-year college or university, and a teacher recommendation. Other factors considered include: academic performance, demonstrated leadership, participation in school and community activities, work experience, a statement of career and educational goals, and diversity. Amazon Future Engineer is currently accepting applications for the high school piece of its program at www.amazonfutureengineer.com.\nAbout Amazon in the Community\nAmazon is committed to ensuring all children and young adults, especially those from underprivileged, underrepresented, and underserved communities, have the resources and skills they need to build their best future.

{"raw_text":"Amazon has created more than 22,000 jobs in Texas and invested over in the state since 2011, including infrastructure and compensation\nAmazon employs more than 20,000 employees across the company\u2019s growing network of North American Tech Hubs\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 28, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced an expansion of its Austin Tech Hub and plans to create 800 new tech jobs in fields including software and hardware engineering, research science, and cloud computing. Together with its customer fulfillment facilities, Amazon has created more than 22,000 full-time jobs in Texas and since 2011 has invested over in the state, including infrastructure and compensation to its employees.\n\u201cIn the last four years, we have created more than a 1,000 jobs in Austin,\u201d said Terry Leeper, General Manager of Amazon\u2019s Austin Tech Hub. \u201cWith a strong pool of technical talent in Austin and a dynamic quality of life, we are excited to continue to expand and create more opportunity in this vibrant city.\u201d\n\u201cThe state of Texas has cultivated a strong and vibrant business environment, leading to more jobs and greater innovation,\u201d said Governor Abbott. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcement and continued investment in the technology sector, Texas will continue to chart a path toward greater economic prosperity.\u201d\n\u201cIt is no surprise that Texas\u2019 booming economy continues to attract innovative companies, both large and small. Amazon\u2019s decision to further expand comes with the recognition that Texas continues to boast a pro-business environment that helps businesses and families to grow, thrive, and succeed,\u201d said Congressman McCaul. \u201cThis expansion will help ensure Austin remains at the cutting-edge of the tech that\u2019s fueling and driving emerging markets.\u201d\n\"I'm pleased that Amazon is doubling down on Austin by expanding the Tech Hub,\u201d said Senator Watson. \u201cAustin is a special place that fosters creativity and innovation, and I appreciate that Amazon has chosen to become an even greater contributor to our dynamic community and economy.\"\n\u201cWe are pleased to see Amazon\u2019s significant investment in the Austin region continue to grow,\u201d said Gary Farmer, Opportunity Austin Chair, Austin Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThis expanding presence is indicative of our region\u2019s ability to provide creative and innovative talent. We\u2019re proud to call Amazon a partner in our efforts to achieve regional prosperity.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s Austin Tech Hub is one of the company\u2019s 17 North American Tech Hubs \u2013 a network of development centers in addition to Amazon\u2019s Seattle and Northern Virginia headquarters. Together, these Hubs have more than 20,000 employees, building new products and services for Amazon customers around the world. Austin-based teams primarily focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Business, Amazon devices, video game design, advertising and more. To accommodate the additional job creation in Austin, Amazon will expand into a new 145,000 square foot office in The Domain, opening in 2020. Amazon\u2019s new office will be located in Domain 10 owned by TIER REIT, which is co-developing the project with Endeavor Real Estate Group.\nNamed #1 on LinkedIn Top Companies in 2018, Amazon provides comprehensive benefits to its employees, including healthcare from day one, 401(k) with 50 percent match and flexible parental leave \u2014from the company\u2019s most senior executives to its hourly FC associates. Amazon also offers a range of programs to equip job seekers and employees with the skills they need for new, in-demand jobs, from paid cloud computing apprenticeships for military veterans, to its innovative Career Choice program, which pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses in in-demand fields, regardless of whether skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. To date, more than 12,000 employees have participated in Career Choice in the United States, pursuing degrees in healthcare, information technology, and many more areas of study.\nSince 2011, Amazon has invested over in Texas, from building customer fulfillment facilities, cloud infrastructure, and a 253-megawatt (MW) wind farm to compensation to its teams. The company estimates that these direct investments in the state contributed more than to Texas\u2019 economy (2011-2017) and generated an additional 30,000 indirect jobs on top of the company\u2019s direct hires. There are also more than 130,000 authors, developers, and small and medium-sized businesses in Texas growing their businesses with Amazon.\nAdditionally, as part of Amazon\u2019s ongoing commitment to the communities where our employees live and work, the Amazon Future Engineer program \u2013 a childhood-to-career program to inspire, educate and propel children and young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities to pursue careers in computer science \u2013 has added more than 90 high schools across Texas to date. Amazon has supported more than a hundred local schools and organizations in Texas through monetary and in-kind donations, and employees have dedicated thousands of volunteer hours to charities such as the North Texas Food Bank and Dallas Special Olympics Competition. In 2017, Amazon also aided with disaster relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey, which included AWS\u2019 support of supplemental call centers for the Red Cross and work with the Texas Homeless Network.\nOver the past seven years, the company has invested more than in the U.S., including corporate offices, development and research centers, fulfillment infrastructure, and compensation to its employees.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

Of the more than 1,000 high schools, more than 700 are classified as Title I schools. Amazon\u2019s funding provides full-year courses designed to inspire, prepare and propel students of all backgrounds to pursue a computer science education and career.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190221005309\/en\/\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a tiny minority from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\n\u201cOur students are hungry for computer science education, but we could not get the funding to bring this class to our school,\u201d said Chad Bobb, a teacher at Pike High School, a Title I school in Indianapolis, Indiana. \u201cAmazon Future Engineer allows us to open our students\u2019 eyes to something that is both interesting and can lead them into rewarding, thriving careers.\u201d\n\u201cIt is so important to ensure that every student in the U.S. has the opportunity to be well-prepared for the highly technical jobs of the present and future,\u201d said Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (Texas), Chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \u201cI welcome initiatives such as the Amazon Future Engineer program that can increase opportunities for young people who have too long been underrepresented in STEM jobs due to race, gender, or socioeconomic status. I\u2019d like to offer my congratulations to the schools in Dallas, and across the country, who have taken the lead in working to promote solutions to this issue by increasing access to computer science education.\u201d\n\u201cThe U.S. Chamber\u2019s Technology Engagement Center is pleased to see Amazon expand this program, as computer science and all STEM education programs are critical to the workforce of the future,\u201d said Tim Day, Senior Vice President of the Chamber Technology Engagement Center (C_TEC). \u201cMore students will have access to the tools they need to be successful, and more businesses will be able to hire employees with the skills necessary to compete in a data driven economy.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to ensure that every child, especially those from underprivileged communities, has an opportunity to study computer science,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cWe are excited more than 1,000 schools will now provide these courses, and look forward to adding 1,000 more schools over the coming months.\u201d\nThe more than 1,000 high schools will offer Intro to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes through curriculum provider, Edhesive. Amazon\u2019s funding provides preparatory lessons, tutorials, professional development for teachers, fully sequenced and paced digital curriculum for students, and live online support every day of the week for both teachers and students. All students participating in this program will receive a free membership to AWS Educate, which provides them with free access to computing power in the AWS Cloud for their coding projects and content to learn about cloud computing.\nLaunched in November, 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underprivileged, underrepresented, and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science.

{"raw_text":"Company\u2019s investment will divert 1 million tons of recyclable material from landfill into the recycling stream eliminating the equivalent of 2 million metric tons of CO2 by 2028\nAmazon\u2019s support will provide 3 million households across the U.S. with curbside recycling\nInitiative adds to Amazon\u2019s waste reduction efforts, including its Frustration-Free Packaging program that has eliminated over 500 million boxes and more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials over the last 10 years\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2018-- (NASDAQ: AMZN) \u2013Amazon today announced that it will invest in Closed Loop Fund to support recycling infrastructure in the United States. Amazon\u2019s investment will increase the availability of curbside recycling for 3 million homes in communities across the country, making it easier for customers to recycle and further develop end markets for recycled commodities. The investment will divert 1 million tons of recyclable material from landfill into the recycling stream and eliminate the equivalent of 2 million metric tons of CO2 by 2028\u2014equivalent to shutting down a coal-fired power plant for six months.\nRoughly half of Americans today lack access to convenient, sufficient curbside recycling at their homes. Closed Loop Fund finances the building of advanced recycling infrastructure and services, bringing this invaluable service to the community while saving taxpayers and municipalities money.\n\u201cThis investment will help build the local capabilities needed to make it easier for our customers and their communities to recycle and to increase the amount of material recycled across the country,\u201d said Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. \u201cWe are investing in Closed Loop Fund\u2019s work because we think everyone should have access to easy, convenient curbside recycling. The more we are all able to recycle, the more we can reduce our collective energy, carbon, and water footprint.\u201d\nClosed Loop Fund invests in sustainable consumer goods, advanced recycling technologies, and the development of the circular economy. It aims over the next 10 years to eliminate more than 16 million tons of greenhouse gas, divert more than 8 million cumulative tons of waste from landfills, improve recycling for more than 18 million households, and save nearly for American cities.\nCEO of Closed Loop Fund Ron Gonen added, \u201cAmazon's investment in Closed Loop Fund is another example of how recycling is good business in America. Companies are seeing that they can meet consumer demand and reduce costs while supporting a more sustainable future and growing good jobs across the country. We applaud Amazon's commitment to cut waste, and we hope their leadership drives other brands and retailers to follow suit.\"\nSolving customers\u2019 needs for recycling can create economic benefits in the cities and towns where they live. Increasing the amount of recycled materials available can also lead to a lower cost of goods sold, and lessen the impacts of transportation, as there is no need to ship waste to landfills. Cities also directly benefit through increased cash flow and jobs, as most recycling is done locally.\nAmazon\u2019s investment in Closed Loop Fund furthers Amazon\u2019s longstanding commitment to reducing packaging waste through its Frustration-Free Packaging programs, which are designed to produce less waste than traditional packaging. Amazon works directly with thousands of manufacturers to help them redesign their packaging, eliminate waste throughout the supply chain, and ensure products arrive undamaged on customers\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon introduced Frustration-Free Packaging 10 years ago, and it has eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials to date, avoiding 500 million shipping boxes.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Brands apply a unique Transparency code to every product unit they manufacture, enabling detection and preventing sales of inauthentic products \u2013 which better protects both brands and customers from counterfeit.\nThis geographic expansion builds on the over 4000 brands that have enrolled in Transparency in the US and have generated over 300 million unique codes.\nSEATTLE\u2014July 10, 2019\u2014Today, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced the expansion of Transparency, its product serialization service, to France, Germany, Italy, Spain, U.K., India, and Canada. When brands use Transparency to apply unique codes to their products, customers, brands, Amazon, and other participants in the supply chain are able to authenticate every unit of a product, better protecting brands and customers from counterfeits at scale. Unique serialization for every product unit is the most effective way to tackle and prevent counterfeits throughout the supply chain, and Transparency\u2019s geographic expansion is the latest in Amazon\u2019s continued investment in scalable, technology-driven solutions to prevent counterfeit.\n\u201cCounterfeiting is an industry-wide concern \u2013 both online and offline. We find the most effective solutions to prevent counterfeit are based on partnerships that combine Amazon\u2019s technology innovation with the sophisticated knowledge and capabilities of brands,\u201d said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president, Amazon Customer Trust and Partner Support. \u201cWe created Transparency to provide brands with a simple, scalable solution that empowers brands and Amazon to authenticate products within the supply chain, stopping counterfeit before it reaches a customer.\u201d\nTransparency is a product serialization service that provides a unique code for every unit that is manufactured. Brands put these codes on its products and every time one of these products is ordered in Amazon\u2019s stores, Amazon scans and verifies the code to ensure only authentic units reach customers. Additionally, customers can use a mobile app to scan the code and verify authenticity regardless of where they purchased their units. Brands can also use Transparency to communicate unique unit-level information, including manufacturing date, manufacturing place, or other enhanced product information (e.g., ingredients).\nMore than 4,000 brands are enrolled in Transparency in the U.S., ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. Hundreds of brands continue to enroll into the service every month. These brands have generated over 300 million unique codes, allowing Amazon to proactively stop over 250,000 counterfeits of Transparency-enabled products from reaching customers. In 2019, for products fully on-boarded into the Transparency service, there have been zero reports of counterfeit from brands or customers who purchased these products on Amazon.\n\"Amazon\u2019s proactive approach and investment in tools like Transparency have allowed us to grow consumer confidence in our products and prevent inauthentic product from ending up in the hands of our customers,\u201d said Matt Petersen, Chief Executive Officer at Neato Robotics, a maker of smart robotic vacuum cleaners.\n\u201cBlocking counterfeits from the source has always been a tough task for us \u2013 it\u2019s something all brand owners face through nearly all channels around the world,\u201d said Bill Mei, Chief Executive Officer at Cowin, a manufacturer of noise cancelling audio devices. \u201cAfter we joined Transparency, our counterfeit problem just disappeared for products protected by the program.\u201d\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"New headquarters will be a full equal to Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle, and is expected to grow to 50,000 employees as part of the company\u2019s ongoing job creation\nAmazon plans to invest over in construction and operation of Amazon HQ2\nIn addition to Amazon\u2019s direct hiring and investment, construction and operation of Amazon HQ2 is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs in construction and related industries, and generate tens of billions of dollars in additional investment in the city where Amazon HQ2 is located\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 7, 2017-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014Amazon today announced plans to open Amazon HQ2, a second company headquarters in North America. Amazon expects to invest over in construction and grow this second headquarters to include as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs. In addition to Amazon\u2019s direct hiring and investment, construction and ongoing operation of Amazon HQ2 is expected to create tens of thousands of additional jobs and tens of billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community. Amazon is opening the Amazon HQ2 Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) now, and local and state government leaders interested in learning more about how they can bring Amazon to their community can visit www.amazon.com\/amazonHQ2.\nAmazon estimates its investments in Seattle from 2010 through 2016 resulted in an additional to the city\u2019s economy \u2013 every dollar invested by Amazon in Seattle generated an additional for the city\u2019s economy overall.\nWith more than 380,000 employees worldwide, Amazon ranks #1 on Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies, #2 on Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired Companies, #1 on The Harris Poll\u2019s Corporate Reputation survey, and #2 on LinkedIn\u2019s U.S. most desirable companies list. Amazon was also recently included in the Military Times\u2019 Best for Vets list of companies committed to providing opportunities for military veterans.\n\u201cWe expect HQ2 to be a full equal to our Seattle headquarters,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. \u201cAmazon HQ2 will bring billions of dollars in up-front and ongoing investments, and tens of thousands of high-paying jobs. We\u2019re excited to find a second home.\u201d\nIn choosing the location for HQ2, Amazon has a preference for:\n\u2022 Metropolitan areas with more than one million people\n\u2022 Urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent\n\u2022 Communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options\nHQ2 could be, but does not have to be:\n\u2022 A development-prepped site. We want to encourage states and communities to think creatively for viable real estate options, while not negatively affecting our preferred timeline.\nAmazon HQ2 will be a complete headquarters for Amazon \u2013 not a satellite office. Amazon expects to hire new teams and executives in HQ2, and will also let existing senior leaders across the company decide whether to locate their teams in HQ1, HQ2 or both. The company expects that employees who are currently working in HQ1 can choose to continue working there, or they could have an opportunity to move if they would prefer to be located in HQ2.\nTo learn more about Amazon\u2019s current Seattle headquarters, plans for Amazon HQ2, and to submit a proposal, visit www.amazon.com\/amazonHQ2.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon. For more information, visit www.amazon.com\/about and follow @AmazonNews.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","metadata":{"keywords":"acquisitions;hire;hiring;invest;invested;investment;investments;invests","title":"Amazon Opens

{"raw_text":"Amazon Provides Robotics Grants to 100 Schools in Underserved and Underrepresented Communities Across the Country to Inspire Next Generation of Computer Scientists\nThe Amazon Future Engineer grants fund FIRST robotics program registrations to start a robotics club, to expand access to computer science education, and a personal tour of a local Amazon fulfillment center\nThousands of children in 100 schools across 21 states set to benefit starting in the fall\nAmazon Future Engineer is a four-part, childhood-to-career program that works to inspire and educate 10 million children and young adults each year from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science and coding\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 12, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and FIRST today announced that 100 schools serving students from underrepresented and underserved communities from across the country will receive an Amazon Future Engineer Robotics Grant to inspire the next generation of computer scientists. The 100 schools across 21 states will receive support to launch FIRST robotics teams, including teacher professional development to learn about robotics, from Amazon to expand access to computer science education in their school, and a tour of a local Amazon fulfillment center. Read more about the new program here.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190412005073\/en\/\nFIRST\u2019s mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills to students in grades K-12. Data from a 5-year longitudinal study of FIRST by Brandeis University shows competitive FIRST robotics programs works for all youth. Across all demographic groups (gender, race, economic status and geography), FIRST students show significant gains in STEM knowledge, STEM interest, STEM career interest, STEM identity, and STEM activity compared to their peers who don\u2019t participate. FIRST students are more likely to major in tech-focused science fields in college; by their second year of college, over 50 percent declare majors in engineering or technology. The impact on young women in FIRST is particularly profound. By their first year of college, female alumnae of FIRST are 3.6 times more likely to take an engineering course, and 1.9 times more likely to take a computer science course than female comparison students.\n\u201cOur students have been working incredibly hard over the course of their educational journeys to be in a position to take rigorous computer science courses, and this experience visiting the fulfillment center, as well as the support to expand our programming next year, is so empowering to them,\u201d said Jake Kuhnline, Assistant Director of Teaching & Learning, KIPP Columbus in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cIt's rare that I hear a bus full of high schoolers talking about robotics, computer science, and the future of programming, but that trip generated that much enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cThe Amazon Future Engineer Robotics Grant is a game changer for middle and high school students throughout 53 KIPP schools around the country,\u201d said Dave Levin, co-founder of KIPP Public Schools. \u201cThe generosity of Amazon will ensure more KIPP students than ever will have the opportunity not only to pursue successful careers in STEM, but help diversify the industry for future generations.\u201d\n\"Amazon is helping FIRST in our goal to make robotics teams and programs available in every school,\u201d said Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST and president of DEKA Research & Development. \u201cIn FIRST, every kid on every team can go pro. They gain a hands-on learning pathway in technology, computer science and engineering that propels them forward and inspires innovation.\"\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to bring thousands of students into Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers to show them the amazing technology operating behind the scenes,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO Consumer Worldwide, Amazon. \u201cThese students are the innovators of the future, and we\u2019re confident that this hands-on experience provided by Amazon Future Engineer will inspire them in their academic pursuits and beyond.\u201d\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a tiny minority from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\nLaunched in November, 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer aims to inspire more than 10 million kids to explore computer science; provide over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; award 100 students with four-year scholarships, as well as offer guaranteed and paid Amazon internships to gain work experience. Amazon Future Engineer is part of Amazon\u2019s investment in computer science\/STEM education. In addition, Amazon Future Engineer has donated more than to organizations that promote computer science\/STEM education across the country.\nAbout Amazon in the Community\nAmazon is committed to ensuring all children and young adults, especially those from underprivileged, underrepresented, and underserved communities, have the resources and skills they need to build their best future. Amazon focuses on building long-term, innovative, and high impact programs that leverage Amazon\u2019s unique assets and culture. Initiatives include Amazon Future Engineer, designed to inspire and excite 10 million children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities each year to pursue an education in computer science, as well as programs that support immediate needs, including fighting childhood hunger by providing access to millions of breakfasts annually through its nationwide Rise and Smile program, addressing family homelessness through donations and housing a homeless shelter in its Seattle headquarters, and global relief efforts for people in need following natural disasters.\nAccomplished inventor Dean Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in 1989 to inspire an appreciation of science and technology in young people. Based in Manchester, N.H., FIRST designs accessible, innovative programs to build self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills while motivating young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, and engineering. With support from over 200 of the Fortune 500 companies and more than in college scholarships, the not-for-profit organization hosts the FIRSTRobotics Competition for students in Grades 9-12; FIRST Tech Challenge for Grades 7-12; FIRST LEGO League for Grades 4-8; and FIRST LEGO League Jr. for Grades K-4. Gracious Professionalism is a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community.

{"raw_text":"Coming from Amazon Original Stories in September 2019, Forward will offer readers mind-bending, binge-worthy short stories from some of today\u2019s most acclaimed authors\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 16, 2019-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014Amazon Original Stories, an imprint of Amazon Publishing, announced today the forthcoming six-part science-fiction collection Forward, featuring original short stories from some of today\u2019s most celebrated voices in fiction, including Blake Crouch, N. K. Jemisin, Veronica Roth, Amor Towles, Paul Tremblay, and Andy Weir. Forward will be available for free on September 17th, 2019 to Prime and Kindle Unlimited customers. Readers can download the collection as a Kindle eBook or Audible audiobook.\nForward explores a central theme: the resounding effects of a pivotal technological moment. While each author started with this same prompt, readers will discover that each story unearths a unique corner of the sci-fi genre, ranging from intimate to epic, grounded to far future, hopeful to harrowing.\nAndy Weir (Artemis, The Martian)imagines a high-tech Las Vegas casino heist; Paul Tremblay (The Cabin at the End of the World) immerses readers in a patient\u2019s mysteriously slow healing process; Amor Towles (A Gentleman in Moscow)explores a fertility clinic\u2019s god-like abilities to alter an unborn child\u2019s life path; Veronica Roth (Divergent trilogy) spins a story of finding connection in the face of our world\u2019s certain destruction; N.K. Jemisin (The Broken Earth series) subverts all expectations when an explorer returns to the ravaged Earth his ancestors fled; and Blake Crouch (Dark Matter) follows a video game designer whose character Maxine unexpectedly \u201cwakes up.\u201d\n\u201cEach story in the Forward collection stands alone as a singular achievement in science fiction, imagined by a storyteller at the top of their game,\u201d said Mikyla Bruder, Publisher, Amazon Publishing. \u201cIn this ambitious collection, these writers deliver a formidable reading experience that will delight their fans and thrill readers new to their work.\u201d\n\u201cI find the theme of the Forward collection particularly exciting,\u201d said Veronica Roth, New York Timesbestselling author of the Divergent trilogy. \u201cSci-fi often skews toward wariness of the future, for good reason, but this collection prompted me to tap into the other side of it, into wonder and imagination. It was a welcome challenge!\u201d\n\u201cThe short story is one of the hardest, most rewarding forms in fiction, and with Amazon Original Stories, we had the tools to gather together the best of the best in sci-fi, fantasy, YA, horror, and historical and bring these groundbreaking stories to a true mass audience,\u201d said Blake Crouch, bestselling author of Dark Matter and the curator of Forward. Crouch\u2019s Wayward Pines trilogy and his novel Good Behavior, both of which were adapted for television, were also published by Amazon Publishing, under the Thomas & Mercer imprint.\n\u201cAmazon Original Stories is all about innovating on what storytelling looks like today, and Forward\u2019s all-star cast of beloved authors is helping us do just that,\u201d said Julia Sommerfeld, Editorial Director, Amazon Original Stories. \u201cWe think of our story collections as reading\u2019s answer to podcasts, and are proud to offer our readers\u2014and listeners\u2014fresh ways to fit binge-worthy narratives into their lives.\u201d\nLaunched in 2017, Amazon Original Stories brings unforgettable short fiction and nonfiction to Kindle. Past collections include the Amazon Original Stories and Amazon Studios joint acquisition The Fairer Sex by Michelle Miller, Warmer by Lauren Groff, Jane Smiley, Jess Walter, and more, and Dark Corners, which features Lisa Unger\u2019s Edgar Award-nominated short The Sleep Tight Motel.

{"raw_text":"States with large rural populations have the fastest-growing small and medium-sized businesses according to Amazon report\nRecent study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that unlocking the digital potential of rural small businesses could add to the U.S. GDP per year\nMore than half of the items sold in Amazon\u2019s stores are from small and medium-sized businesses\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced the 10 states with the fastest-growing small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) selling in Amazon\u2019s stores. The report examined year-over-year sales growth of businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores across all 50 states and found that SMBs in Mississippi are growing the fastest, with businesses in Nebraska, Maine, Texas, and Indiana rounding out the top five. Third-party gross physical merchandise sales \u2013 primarily comprised of SMBs selling in Amazon stores \u2013 surpassed in 2018 and make up more than half of the units sold in Amazon\u2019s stores.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to see so many small businesses in states with large rural populations like Mississippi, Maine, Vermont, and North Dakota growing their sales fastest in our stores,\u201d said Nick Denissen, VP at Amazon. \u201cOnline selling enables rural businesses to complement their offline sales in physical stores by reaching customers they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to as easily. Research shows that increased adoption of online tools and digital services could grow annual revenues of rural small businesses by 21% over the next three years and create 360,000 jobs in rural communities. Amazon continues to invest billions of dollars to develop tools and services that help small businesses reach new customers.\u201d\nThe top 10 states with the fastest-growing SMBs:\nA recent study conducted with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that nearly 20 percent of rural small businesses in America generate at least 80 percent of their revenue by selling their products and services online. The study also found that online tools and technology have the highest potential impact on rural small businesses with revenue under .\n\u201cSmall businesses in rural America are significant contributors to the U.S. economy. Access to digital tools allows rural small businesses to successfully start, scale and compete in a global economy \u2013 regardless of their size and location,\u201d said Tim Day, senior vice president of C_TEC, the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Technology Engagement Center.\n\u201cSince joining Amazon Handmade in 2015, my sales have doubled year-over-year,\u201d said Casey Everett, owner of Hearth and Harrow based in Rockport, Maine. \u201cSelling online has allowed me to create a business I love in a community that I love. With Amazon, I\u2019m able to reach customers in Germany from my home-studio in Maine \u2013 it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nSmall and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores come from every state in the U.S., and more than 130 countries around the world. In 2018, more than 50,000 SMBs exceeded in sales in Amazon\u2019s stores worldwide, and nearly 200,000 surpassed in sales. The number of SMBs eclipsing in sales in Amazon\u2019s stores worldwide grew by 20 percent last year.\nTo help small and medium-sized businesses thrive, Amazon last year created Amazon Storefronts, a store for customers to shop exclusively from U.S. small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores. With Storefronts, customers can shop a curated collection of over one million products and deals from nearly 20,000 U.S. small and medium-sized businesses, and learn more about profiled businesses through featured videos and stories.\nThe company is also hosting a variety of events to educate sellers, including Amazon Academy events across Europe, the Boost Conference specifically for businesses using Fulfillment by Amazon, and the new Selling Partner Summits across the U.S. The new Selling Partner Summits are a series of six conferences designed to help sellers grow their business in Amazon\u2019s stores. The Selling Partner Summits, which were announced in February, sold out quickly in just six weeks.\nTo learn more about small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores, visit: aboutamazon.com\/smallbusiness.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Amazon has partnered with GE Capital Aviation Services to lease an additional fifteen Boeing 737-800 aircraft that will enter the air network by 2021\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 18, 2019-- (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2013 Amazon continues to invest in ways to provide fast, free shipping for customers. Today, at the International Paris Air Show, the company announced a partnership with GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) to lease an additional fifteen Boeing 737-800 cargo aircraft. These fifteen aircraft will be in addition to the five Boeing 737-800\u2019s already leased from GECAS and announced earlier this year. The aircraft will fly in the United States out of the more than 20 air gateways in the Amazon Air network.\n\u201cThese new aircraft create additional capacity for Amazon Air, building on the investment in our Prime Free One-Day program,\u201d said Dave Clark, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations at Amazon. \u201cBy 2021, Amazon Air will have a portfolio of 70 aircraft flying in our dedicated air network.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to support Amazon Air\u2019s dedicated air network,\u201d said Richard Greener, GECAS Cargo\u2019s Senior Vice President. \u201cThe capability of the 737-800 freighter will further Amazon\u2019s ability to provide reliable and regional delivery to its customers for years to come.\u201d\nAmazon Air\u2019s operation launched in 2016 supporting package delivery to the rapidly growing number of customers who love fast delivery, affordable prices and vast selection. With advanced algorithms and software used for capacity and route planning, the Amazon Air operation can transport hundreds of thousands of packages per day. Amazon will open new air facilities this year at Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Wilmington Air Park, and Chicago Rockford International Airport. The main Air Hub at the Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky International Airport will open in 2021. Since its launch, Amazon\u2019s air cargo operation has invested millions of dollars and created thousands of new jobs at locations across the U.S.\nAmazon has launched several initiatives to ensure fast delivery speeds and supply chain capacity for its customers, including its Delivery Service Partner program, Amazon Flex, the company\u2019s mobile application that allows individuals to sign-up, be vetted and begin delivering for Amazon, a dedicated network of over 10,000 trailers to increase trucking capacity and, now, the expanded fleet of cargo aircraft. These efforts join Amazon\u2019s robust worldwide network of more than 185 fulfillment centers where the company uses high-end algorithms, robotics, machine learning and other technological innovations to increase delivery speeds for customers. Amazon is now bringing the same technological expertise to efforts in the transportation space to increase shipping capacity for customers.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190722005123\/en\/\n\u201cFor many years, I have enjoyed a wonderful relationship with Brilliance Audio, an Amazon company, and later with Amazon Original Stories,\u201d says Dean Koontz. \u201cAlthough there were numerous options for the future, it was most natural to sign with the team at Amazon Publishing, which presented a marketing and publicity plan smarter and more ambitious than anything I\u2019d ever seen before. This new arrangement is so exciting, I\u2019ve been creatively rejuvenated. The times are changing, and it\u2019s invigorating to be where change is understood and embraced.\u201d\n\u201cWe are honored Dean has chosen Amazon Publishing to bring his newest work to readers,\u201d says Mikyla Bruder, Publisher of Amazon Publishing. \u201cBuilding on the success of Dean\u2019s Amazon Charts best-selling short story, Ricochet Joe, our first publication together, we\u2019re excited to expand our relationship with five new books from Thomas & Mercer and an episodic collection of short thrillers from Amazon Original Stories, delivering the kind of exhilarating and deeply resonant suspense his millions of fans expect and we know new readers will love.\u201d\nAmazon Publishing Editorial Director Grace Doyle acquired North American rights in the five-book deal for the mystery, thriller, and true crime imprint, Thomas & Mercer, and Editorial Director Julia Sommerfeld acquired World English in the collection deal for the digital- and audio-only imprint, Amazon Original Stories.

Readers and listeners can download the collection as a Kindle eBook or as an Audible audiobook on November 12th.\nWhen he was a senior in college, Koontz won an Atlantic Monthly fiction competition and has been writing ever since. His books are published in 38 languages and he has sold over 500 million copies to date.

Kaling\u2019s essays will be available for free to Prime and Kindle Unlimited customers.

In her two best-selling memoirs, Why Not Me? and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, readers fell in love with Mindy\u2019s awkward coming-of-age stories and rooted for her bold dreams. Now, Kaling shares her charming and intimate reflections on life changes\u2014big and small\u2014from the past few years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting for me to share the secrets of how I balance being a professional writer, actor, and single mom in a new collection of essays,\u201d says Mindy Kaling. \u201cI mean, it would be so exciting to share those secrets. I don\u2019t have them. Like, not even close. This morning I bribed my baby with a remote control to get my car keys back.

We\u2019re privileged to be a part of bringing Mindy\u2019s deeply personal essay collection to life, and can\u2019t wait for readers to laugh, cry, and fall in love with her all over again.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon Original Stories is focused on offering our readers and listeners binge-worthy narratives, and Mindy Kaling is the perfect author for this,\u201d says Julia Sommerfeld, Editorial Director of Amazon Original Stories. \u201cMindy is a truly innovative storyteller and her hilarious and heartfelt essays are unputdownable.

{"raw_text":"A new centralized air hub at the Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) in Hebron will help the company meet demand from Amazon Prime members for fast, reliable delivery\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2017-- (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2014Amazon has been an active member of the business community in Kentucky for nearly 20 years, employing more than 10,000 people in full-time jobs across 11 fulfillment center locations. Today, the company announced it is creating new jobs and investing even further in Kentucky with plans to build a centralized air hub to support its growing fleet of Prime Air cargo planes. At the site when it opens, the company expects to create more than 2,000 new jobs.\n\u201cAs we considered places for the long-term home for our air hub operations, Hebron quickly rose to the top of the list with a large, skilled workforce, centralized location with great connectivity to our nearby fulfillment locations, and an excellent quality of living for employees. We feel strongly that with these qualities as a place to do business, our investments will support Amazon and customers well into the future,\u201d said Dave Clark, Amazon Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to add 2,000-plus Amazon employees to join the more than 10,000 who work with us today across our robust operations in Kentucky.\u201d\nLast year, Amazon entered into agreements with two carriers to lease 40 dedicated cargo airplanes to support Prime members with fast, free shipping. Today, 16 of those planes are in service for Amazon customers with more planes rolling out over time. Amazon\u2019s Prime Air hub at CVG will support Amazon\u2019s dedicated fleet of Prime Air cargo planes by loading, unloading and sorting packages.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s Prime Air hub promises to revolutionize the fulfillment industry worldwide, and Kentucky is excited to partner with them as they embark on this disruptive, transformative and exciting venture,\u201d said Gov. Bevin. \u201cKentucky\u2019s ideal location, proven workforce and an already extensive shipping and logistics industry have been the backbone of our relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years. This new project will pay dividends to both the company and our state, and we are truly grateful for the jobs and economic impact it will bring to the commonwealth.\u201d\nFull-time employees at Amazon receive highly-competitive pay, health insurance, disability insurance, retirement savings plans and company stock. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families. Amazon also offers hourly employees its Career Choice program which helps train employees for in-demand jobs at Amazon and other companies so that they can prepare for the future and take full advantage of the nation's innovation economy. The program pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses in in-demand, high-wage fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a future career at Amazon. Over 9,000 employees have participated in Career Choice and more are signing up every day.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to ensure CVG is a great place to do business and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that Amazon recognized those efforts with plans to build a top-in-class air cargo hub at our airport,\u201d said Candace S. McGraw, CEO of the CVG Airport. \u201cA vibrant airport improves the economic vitality of the region and adding thousands of new jobs through establishing this hub at CVG will certainly be transformational for the local economy and local businesses.\u201d\nAmazon has launched several initiatives to ensure great delivery speeds and supply chain capacity for its customers, including Amazon Flex, the company\u2019s mobile application that allows individuals to sign-up, be vetted and begin delivering for Amazon, a dedicated network of 4,000 trailers to increase trucking capacity and a network of air cargo planes. These efforts join Amazon\u2019s robust worldwide network of 149 fulfillment centers and over 20 sortation centers where the company uses algorithms, robotics, machine learning and other technological innovations to increase delivery speeds for customers. Amazon is now bringing the same technological expertise to efforts in the transportation space to increase shipping capacity for its customers.\nThe company plans to offer job opportunities at any Amazon site across the U.S. to those involved in the package sortation that occurs today in Wilmington.\nAmazon recently announced plans to create more than 100,000 jobs across the U.S. over the next 18 months.

Amazon invests billions of dollars each year on infrastructure, tools, and services that enable small and medium-sized businesses to reach new customers and successfully sell their products online. The most recent investments include the introduction of selling tools and services across Fulfillment by Amazon, Seller Central, Amazon Advertising, and more.\n\u201cWe are constantly listening to seller feedback and rolling out new tools based on their insights to help small and medium-sized businesses succeed selling in our stores,\u201d said Ian Simpson, VP Selling Partner Services at Amazon. \u201cFrom updates to brand analytics to a new global selling workflow, businesses have access to infrastructure, technology, and insights to help them reach more customers and grow their business online. Small and medium-sized businesses are growing sales in Amazon\u2019s stores at a faster rate than Amazon\u2019s retail business and these new tools and services serve as a catalyst to enable additional growth.\u201d\n\u201cThe insights and analytics we access through Seller Central have been a game changer for our business! New tools like Brand Analytics with information on clicks and conversions across keywords have been incredible for marketing our brands,\u201d said Liran Hirschkorn, owner of 1981 LLC. \u201cThese exciting updates continue to make Amazon the best opportunity in retail for our small business.\u201d\nA sample of recently launched tools and services for sellers includes:\n\u2022 Brand Analytics: Enhanced brand analytics provide brand owners with information on popular search terms and comparable products.\n\u2022 Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) Monthly Storage and Removal Fee Waiver: With the monthly FBA storage and removal fees waived, sellers in select regions can now test out limited quantity new-to-Amazon products for a promotional period.\n\u2022 Global Registration Experience: A new Sell Across the World (SAW) workflow provides personalized guidance to help sellers expand globally.\n\u2022 Interactive Seller University Content: Refreshed Seller University interactive eLearning content offers Selling Partners live practice opportunities to help them better operate an Amazon store.\nTo further help small and medium-sized businesses thrive in Amazon\u2019s stores, Amazon hosts a variety of events to educate sellers, including Amazon Academy events across Europe, the Boost Conference specifically for businesses using the FBA service, and the new Selling Partner Summits across the U.S. The new Selling Partner Summits are a series of six conferences designed to help sellers grow their business in Amazon\u2019s stores. The conferences, which were announced in February, sold out quickly in just six weeks.\nMore than half of all units sold in Amazon\u2019s stores are from small and medium-sized businesses. The 2018 Amazon Small Business Impact Report revealed that there are more than one million U.S.-based small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores. Amazon estimates that small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon stores have created more than 900,000 jobs worldwide. In 2018, more than 50,000 small and medium-sized businesses exceeded in sales in Amazon\u2019s stores worldwide, and nearly 200,000 surpassed in sales. The number of small and medium-sized businesses eclipsing in sales in Amazon\u2019s stores worldwide grew by 20 percent last year.\nTo view all tools available to help small and medium-sized businesses grow in Amazon\u2019s stores, visit: amazon.com\/sellercentral.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Announces 150 New Tools and Services Have Launched in 2019 to Help Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Grow Their Online Sales\nAmazon is on track to invest more than in 2019 in infrastructure, tools, services, people, and programs to help third-party sellers succeed\nRecently launched tools and services include Target Inventory Levels, global rollout of the Amazon Marketplace Appstore, and Sold by Amazon\nIndependent third-party sellers \u2013 primarily small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 made up 58% of all physical gross merchandise sold in Amazon\u2019s stores in 2018\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 22, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced 150 tools and services have been launched since the beginning of the year to help independent small and medium-sized businesses grow their sales in Amazon\u2019s stores. Tools like Sold by Amazon help sellers manage the pricing of their products in Amazon\u2019s stores, while fulfillment tools like Target Inventory Levels allow sellers to better manage their Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) inventory and, in turn, increase sales. New tools and services, along with infrastructure, programs, and people, are part of the more than Amazon is on track to invest this year to empower independent small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon\u2019s stores.\nIndependent third-party sellers \u2013 primarily small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 made up 58% of all physical gross merchandise sold in Amazon\u2019s stores in 2018 and their sales far exceeded on Prime Day in July this year. These businesses have created an estimated 1.6 million jobs worldwide.\nAmazon spends billions of dollars every year to help small and medium-sized businesses around the globe succeed in Amazon\u2019s stores. In addition to infrastructure, personnel, tools, and services, investments go towards programs such as Amazon Storefronts, Amazon Handmade, Amazon Launchpad, Amazon Business, Fulfillment by Amazon, Amazon Global Selling, Merch by Amazon, and Amazon Lending, which help small businesses grow.\n\u201cSmall and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of the economy, and we are committed to empowering them,\u201d said Nicholas Denissen, Amazon Vice President of Small Business. \u201cAs part of our dedication to supporting independent retailers, we have thousands of employees around the globe who work hard on their behalf, developing tools and services to help them grow their sales in Amazon\u2019s stores. Ultimately, our success depends on their success.\u201d\nNew tools and services \u2013 from inventory trackers, pricing tools, sales reports, and product branding and marketing tools, to educational videos and webinars \u2013 help level the playing field for small and medium-sized businesses and lower barriers of entry for them to start selling in Amazon\u2019s stores. Delivered through Seller Central, the business management command center, these tools and services give small and medium-sized businesses access to valuable sales and inventory insights as well as resources to help them manage and grow their business with Amazon. Types of recently introduced tools and services include:\n\u2022 Fulfillment and inventory tools \u2013 The Target Inventory Levels tool launched in the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Spain, France, and Germany to help selling partners obtain better insights into their FBA inventory. Achieving suggested inventory levels increases sales through more 1-Day delivery eligibility, and qualifies selling partners for lower storage fees.\n\u2022 Appstore and third-party tools \u2013 The Amazon Marketplace Appstore expanded globally into Europe, India, Japan, and Australia. The Amazon Marketplace Appstore helps selling partners identify trusted third-party applications that complement Amazon\u2019s free tools and help them streamline their business operations. With more than 200 apps available, selling partners can find tools and services across a range of categories including pricing, advertising, and inventory management.\n\u2022 Pricing management tools \u2013 Sold by Amazon, a free, opt-in service, helps selling partners save time and increase sales by automating prices so they can consistently and effortlessly offer customers great prices. Selling partners have peace of mind that they will never receive less than the established price for a product, even if the product is sold to an Amazon customer for less.\n\u2022 Business reports and analytics tools \u2013 The Product Opportunities dashboard can help selling partners find new product opportunities that align with how they want to grow and scale their business. To do so, this tool generates customized reports based on business analytics and data that provide curated guidance for selling partners, like purchasing trends and requests for quantity discounts, which help inform their decisions for how to grow their selection. Selling partners using Amazon Business can use the new Marketplace Business Opportunities Portal reports to find more product listing opportunities for their business.\n\u2022 Seller University\u2013 An improved, redesigned Seller University portal helps selling partners find relevant educational content easier. In addition, Amazon launched a feature in Seller Central that gives selling partners personalized guidance about additional selling programs and features that they can experiment with to accelerate their growth. Each recommendation includes rich educational content (including Seller University videos) to help selling partners learn more about the programs.\n\u201cBased on our recent survey data, we know that greater adoption of digital technology, such as online retail capabilities and tools, could unlock small business job creation and growth to the tune of 360,000 jobs and over the next three years with the greatest potential impact on small businesses in rural America with annual revenues under ,\u201d said Tim Day, Senior Vice President of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Technology Engagement Center (C_TEC). \u201cTo unlock this potential, the Chamber and Amazon share a goal of incentivizing entrepreneurship and enabling small business growth.\u201d\nAmazon also invests hundreds of millions of dollars each year in personnel and tools to earn the trust of customers and sellers. As part of that investment, Project Zero launched this year in the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. Project Zero combines Amazon\u2019s advanced technology, machine learning, and innovation with the sophisticated knowledge that brands have of their own intellectual property and how best to detect counterfeits of their products. Through three powerful tools \u2013 automated protections, self-service counterfeit removal, and product serialization \u2013 Project Zero allows brands and Amazon to work together to drive counterfeits to zero. Additionally, Transparency expanded this year to the U.K., Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Canada, and India. Brands in Transparency apply a unique code to every product unit they manufacture, enabling detection and preventing sales of inauthentic products.\nThe 2019 SMB Impact Report, introduced in May, highlighted how Amazon empowers the millions of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), content creators, and developers in the U.S. and worldwide working with Amazon. This year\u2019s report revealed there are more than 1.9 million SMBs, content creators, and developers in the U.S. currently working with Amazon. The number of SMBs eclipsing in sales in Amazon\u2019s stores worldwide grew by 20 percent last year.\nTo learn more about the millions of small and medium-sized businesses growing with Amazon, visit: aboutamazon.com\/supporting-small-businesses.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"The new fulfillment center will total more than 650,000 square feet, creating more than 1,000 full-time jobs\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 10, 2019-- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open its first fulfillment center in Idaho, creating more than 1,000 full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits and opportunities to work alongside Amazon robotics in an industry-leading workplace. The state-of-the-art facility will be located in Nampa, Idaho, and will open in 2020.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to open our first customer fulfillment center in Idaho and to bring more than 1,000 full-time jobs to the city,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon\u2019s Vice President of Global Customer Fulfillment. \u201cAmazon is committed to creating a positive economic impact in Nampa and enhancing the customer experience throughout the region.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s investment in Nampa will add job opportunities for our citizens and create a ripple effect of economic activity throughout the region,\u201d Idaho Governor Brad Little said. \u201cThe investment demonstrates that Idaho\u2019s workforce and economy continue to attract the ideas and businesses that thrive in a knowledge-based economy. We are proud that Amazon chose Idaho to expand and do business.\u201d\nAmazon will fulfill customer orders such as books, electronics and toys from this 650,000-square-foot fulfillment center. All associates will go through safety training and ongoing coaching and will have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs such as Career Choice. The company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, over 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\nNampa Mayor Debbie Kling said, \u201cI would like to thank Amazon for choosing Nampa to locate their newest fulfillment center. Their investment in local transportation improvements and a competitive employment package represents a significant opportunity for our community. The City of Nampa will do everything we can to support the expedited construction timeline and we look forward to being part of the Amazon family.\u201d\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families. In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based in Idaho. There are more than 11,000 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Idaho growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services.\nThis project is being developed in partnership with Pannotoni Development Co. Inc.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

Governor Karyn Polito. \u201cWe are grateful for this increased commitment to STEM careers and education, and are excited about the opportunities afforded by end-to-end capabilities, including design and advanced manufacturing, all in one site.\u201d\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Amazon Robotics Division to Westborough! The investment of this international company in our community demonstrates the ability of the regional economy and its workforce to attract innovation and technology. We look forward to a strong partnership with Amazon Robotics,\u201d said Kristi Williams, Town Manager, Westborough.\nAmazon provides highly competitive benefits to full-time employees \u2014 from the company\u2019s most senior executives to its hourly fulfillment center associates. These benefits include comprehensive healthcare from day one, 401(k) retirement savings plan with company match, and up to 20-weeks of paid parental leave. Through its Upskilling 2025 initiative, Amazon has also committed to programs aimed at providing its employees with the skills they need for new, in-demand jobs, from paid cloud computing apprenticeships to its Career Choice program, which pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses in in-demand fields, regardless of whether skills are relevant to a career at Amazon.\nSince 2011, Amazon has invested over in Massachusetts, from building customer fulfillment infrastructure and research facilities to compensation to its teams. The company estimates that these direct investments in the state contributed an additional to the Massachusetts\u2019 economy and generated an additional 7,000 indirect jobs on top of the company\u2019s direct hires. There are also tens of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, authors, and entrepreneurs in Massachusetts who are growing their businesses with tools like Marketplace, Fulfillment By Amazon, Kindle Direct Publishing, and Amazon Web Services.\nAs a part of Amazon\u2019s ongoing commitment to the communities where employees live and work, the Amazon Future Engineer program \u2014 a childhood-to-career program to inspire, educate, and propel children and young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities to try computer science \u2014 serves more than 10 million students each year across the country. In Massachusetts specifically, Amazon Future Engineer is funding computer science classes in more than 40 high schools across the state. Amazon is also proud to support St. Mary\u2019s Center for Women and Children, a leader in supporting families and empowering women experiencing homelessness in the Boston area. Through its partnership with Amazon, St. Mary\u2019s Center has raised nearly to fund a new Community Resource Center on its Dorchester campus, which supports families transitioning to permanent housing and those on the brink of homelessness.\nWith 750,000 employees worldwide, Amazon has been recognized on LinkedIn\u2019s Top Companies list for the past four years, ranked #2 in the Fortune 2017 and 2018 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies, #5 in Fast Company's 2018 World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies and 2019 50 Best Workplaces for Innovators. Amazon has more than 400,000 full and part-time employees in the U.S., across more than 40 states and 250 different counties, two headquarters, 18 Tech Hubs, more than 150 fulfillment centers, sortation centers and delivery stations, and more than three dozen Amazon Go, Amazon 4-Star and Amazon Books retail stores. Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than in the U.S., including infrastructure and compensation to our employees.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

Once complete, the new solar farm will provide 149 megawatts (MW) of new renewable capacity.\nAmazon\u2019s newest renewable energy solar projects in the US will be located in Lee County, Illinois and in Northern Virginia. Together, they total 180 MW and are expected to generate almost 400,000 MWh of renewable energy annually. This will be Amazon\u2019s first large-scale renewable energy project in the state of Illinois and ninth in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nOnce complete, the three new Amazon renewable energy solar projects will provide an estimated 329 MW of additional renewable capacity supplying energy to the grids supporting the company\u2019s fulfillment network in Europe and Amazon Web Services data centers, which power Amazon and millions of AWS customers globally.\nTo date, Amazon has launched over 70 renewable energy projects that will provide over 1,900 MW of renewable capacity and are projected to deliver more than 5.3 million MWh of renewable energy annually. These projects include 21 utility-scale wind and solar farms and more than 50 solar rooftops installed on fulfillment centers and sort centers around the globe.\n\u201cEarlier this year, we announced The Climate Pledge, setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net zero carbon by 2040. We also plan to run on 80% renewable energy by 2024 and 100% renewable energy by 2030,\u201d said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability, Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to investing in renewable energy as a critical step toward addressing our carbon footprint globally.\u201d\n\u201cAs we work to put our state on a path to 100% clean and renewable energy, Illinois is proud to have Amazon invest in a major solar project in our state,\u201d said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. \u201cAddressing climate change will take all of us working together, and leadership from state governments and the business community will demonstrate how we can sustainably power a modern economy and create good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\u201cI applaud Amazon for their investment in renewable energy projects in the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d said Virginia Senator Mark R. Warner. \u201cThis solar energy project will generate 80 megawatts of renewable energy, which will help lead to a cleaner and healthier environment.\u201d\nTo track progress toward these goals, Amazon launched a new sustainability website to report on its sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance. The site includes information on Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics that share the progress the company is making towards reaching The Climate Pledge. The new goals, commitments, investments, and programs build on Amazon\u2019s long-term commitment to sustainability through existing innovative programs, including Shipment Zero \u2013 Amazon\u2019s vision to make all shipments net zero carbon, with 50% net zero carbon by 2030; sustainable packaging initiatives like Frustration-Free Packaging and Ship in Own Container, which have reduced packaging waste by 25% since 2015; renewable energy programs; investments in the circular economy with the Closed Loop Fund; and numerous other initiatives happening every day by teams across Amazon.\nVisit https:\/\/sustainability.aboutamazon.com\/ to view the company\u2019s new sustainability report and learn more.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Continues Investments in Renewable Energy \u2013 Announces Two New Renewable Energy Projects in U.S. and EU; Now Has 66 Projects Globally, Including 51 Solar Rooftops\nAmazon\u2019s second renewable energy project in the Republic of Ireland and seventh in the Commonwealth of Virginia are expected to produce approximately 168,000 MWh of clean energy annually to support Amazon\u2019s goal to power 100% of its global operations with renewable energy\nProjects will supply clean energy to the grids supporting the company\u2019s Amazon Web Services datacenters that power Amazon and millions of AWS customers globally\nGlobally, Amazon has 66 renewable energy projects \u2013 including 51 solar rooftops \u2013 that have the capacity to generate 1,342 MW and deliver more than 3.9 million MWh of energy annually\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 1, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced the company\u2019s 65th and66th renewable energy projects. Amazon\u2019s newest renewable energy project in the EU will be located in Cork, Ireland, and will be the second Amazon Wind Farm in the Republic of Ireland. Once complete, the new Amazon Wind Farm will provide 23.2 megawatts (MW) of renewable capacity, with expected generation of 68,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy annually. Amazon\u2019s newest renewable energy project in the U.S. will be located in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and will be the seventh Amazon Solar Farm in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Once complete, the new Amazon Solar Farm will provide 45 megawatts (MW) of renewable capacity and is expected to generate 100,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy annually. Both projects are expected to begin producing clean energy in 2020 and will supply clean energy to the grids supporting the company\u2019s Amazon Web Services datacenters, which power Amazon and millions of AWS customers globally.\nAdditionally, Amazon\u2019s investments in renewable energy were recently recognized in the Solar Energy Industries Association\u2019s (SEIA) 2018 Solar Means Business Report, which ranked Amazon #1 in the U.S. for amount of corporate on-site solar installed in 2018, and #2 for total amount of solar installed to date. Amazon\u2019s solar projects in the U.S. have offset the CO2 equivalent of more than 200 million miles of truck deliveries. Globally, Amazon has 66 renewable energy projects \u2013 including 51 solar rooftops \u2013 that are expected to generate 1,342 MW of renewable capacity and deliver more than 3.9 million MWh of clean energy annually.\n\u201cPlaying a significant role in helping to reduce the sources of human-induced climate change is an important commitment for Amazon,\u201d said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability, Amazon. \u201cMajor investments in renewable energy are a critical step to address our carbon footprint globally. We will continue to invest in these projects, and look forward to additional investments this year and beyond.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the Climate Action Plan, we are committing that 70 percent of Ireland\u2019s electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030. Industry leadership is key to helping us reach this target,\u201d said Richard Bruton, Ireland\u2019s Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. \u201cThis project is another example of AWS\u2019s commitment to renewable projects in Ireland, adding clean energy to the grid, and supporting Ireland\u2019s climate commitments. Construction will begin on this project this year and will start contributing to Ireland\u2019s renewable energy capacity by 2020. We look forward to continuing to work with AWS as we strive to make Ireland a leader in the renewable energy space.\u201d\n\u201cI applaud Amazon for their continued investment in clean and renewable energy projects in the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d said Virginia Senator Mark R. Warner. \u201cThis solar energy project in Pittsylvania County will lead to a cleaner environment and more jobs in the community.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the announcement of these new projects, which will help bring more renewable energy to the Commonwealth of Virginia where Amazon has already helped bring significant solar energy projects online,\u201d said Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. \u201cAmazon\u2019s new solar farm in Virginia will create jobs and economic development in rural Virginia, and will continue to build upon our role as a leading state for renewable energy in the U.S.\u201d\nBeyond investments in wind and solar, Amazon has a long history of commitment to sustainability through innovative programs such as Shipment Zero, Frustration-Free Packaging, Ships in Own Container, investments in the circular economy with the Closed Loop Fund, and numerous other initiatives happening every day by teams across Amazon. Amazon has also implemented the District Energy Project that uses recycled energy to heat and cool more than 3 million square feet of office space.

{"raw_text":"SEATTLE--September 27, 2000\u2014 Amazon.com today issued the following statement regarding random price testing:\nSome news reports over the last several weeks have incorrectly characterized a recent Amazon.com random price test as a test based on customer demographic information. These reports were incorrect and were not based on the facts.\nContrary to these reports, Amazon.com varied the discount levels on a totally random basis, not with respect to customer demographic information. The purpose of the test was to determine how much sales are affected by lower prices. In retrospect, this random testing was a mistake, and we regret it because it created uncertainty and complexity for our customers, and our job is to simplify shopping for customers. That is why, more than two weeks ago, in response to customer feedback, we changed our policy to protect customers should we ever do random price testing again (and currently we have no plans to do so). Now, if we ever do such a test again, we'll automatically give customers who purchased a test item the lowest test price for that item at the conclusion of the test period\u2014thereby ensuring that all customers pay the lowest available price. Under this new policy, by Sept. 14, we had refunded to 6,896 customers an average of $3.10 as a result of the DVD random price test.\n\u201cWe've never tested and we never will test prices based on customer demographics,\u201d said Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. \u201cWhat we did was a random price test, and even that was a mistake because it created uncertainty for customers rather than simplifying their lives. The policy we put in place two weeks ago removes that uncertainty.\u201d\nSome details about the DVD pricing test:\nAmazon.com (Amazon.com, Inc., and its subsidiaries) is the Internet's No. 1 music, No. 1 DVD and video, and No. 1 book retailer. Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) opened its virtual doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995 and today offers Earth's Biggest Selection, along with online auctions and free electronic greeting cards. Amazon.com seeks to be the world's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online. Amazon.com lists more than 18 million unique items in categories including books, CDs, toys, electronics, videos, DVDs, tools and hardware, lawn and patio items, kitchen products, software, and video games. Through Amazon.com zShops, any business or individual can sell virtually anything to Amazon.com's more than 23 million customers, and with Amazon.com Payments, sellers can accept credit card transactions, avoiding the hassles of offline payments. The company also participates in sothebys.amazon.com, the leading auction site for guaranteed art, jewelry and collectibles, at www.sothebys.amazon.com.\nAmazon.com operates three international Web sites: www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de. It also operates the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com), the Web's comprehensive and authoritative source of information on more than 220,000 movies and entertainment programs and 800,000 cast and crew members dating from the birth of film in 1892 to 2003.\nAmazon Anywhere is the leader in mobile e-commerce, providing access from anywhere in the world to Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and through handheld wireless Internet devices that use HDML or the Wireless Application Protocol.\nAmazon.com has invested in leading Internet retailers that are improving the lives of customers by making shopping easier and more convenient: Greenlight.com, the only company that offers car buyers the control of auto purchasing online with ongoing service and support from local dealerships, at www.greenlight.com; drugstore.com, an online retail and information source for health, beauty, wellness, personal care and pharmacy, at www.drugstore.com; Pets.com, the online leader for pet products, expert information, and services, at www.pets.com; Gear.com, which offers brand-name sporting goods at prices from 20 to 90 percent off retail, at www.gear.com; Ashford.com, the leading Internet retailer of luxury and premium products and the Web's No. 1 retailer of watches and jewelry, at www.ashford.com; Audible, Inc., the leader in Internet-delivered spoken audio for PC-based listening or playback on AudibleReady portable digital audio devices, at www.audible.com; and eZiba.com, a leading online retailer of handcrafted products from around the world, at www.eziba.com.\nAmazon.com also has a minority interest in NextCard, Inc., considered the industry's leading issuer of consumer credit on the Internet, at www.nextcard.com; and Kozmo.com, the world's leading \u201ce-mmediate\u201d Internet-to-door delivery service, at www.kozmo.com.\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that include, among others, Amazon.com's limited operating history, anticipated losses, significant amount of indebtedness, unpredictability of future revenues, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results, seasonality, consumer trends, competition, risk of distribution center expansion, risks related to fourth quarter performance, risks of system interruption, management of potential growth, inventory risks, risks related to auction and zShops services, risks related to fraud and Amazon.com Payments, and risks of new business areas, international expansion, business combinations, strategic alliances and the Amazon Commerce Network.

Once complete, the new Amazon Wind Farm will provide 50 megawatts (MW) of new renewable capacity with expected generation of 168,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy annually, enough to power 46,000 UK homes.\nAmazon\u2019s newest renewable energy solar projects in the US will be located in Warren County, North Carolina, and Prince George County, Virginia. Together, they total 215 MW and are expected to generate 500,997 MWh of energy annually. This will be Amazon\u2019s second renewable energy project in the state of North Carolina and eighth renewable energy project in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nOnce complete, the three new Amazon renewable energy wind and solar projects will provide 265 MW of additional renewable capacity and are expected to begin producing energy in 2021, supplying energy to the company\u2019s Amazon Web Services data centers, which power Amazon and millions of AWS customers globally.\nTo date, Amazon has launched 18 utility-scale wind and solar renewable energy projects that will generate over 1,600 MW of renewable capacity and deliver more than 4.6 million MWh of clean energy annually \u2013 enough to power 368,000 U.S. homes. Amazon has also installed more than 50 solar rooftops on fulfillment centers and sort centers around the globe that generate 98 MW of renewable capacity and deliver 130,000 MWh of clean energy annually.\n\u201cIn addition to the environmental benefits inherently associated with running applications in the cloud, Amazon is committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024. We\u2019ve announced eight projects this year and have more projects on the horizon \u2013 and we\u2019re committed to investing in renewable energy as a critical step toward addressing our carbon footprint globally,\u201d said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability, Amazon. \u201cWith nearly 70 renewable energy projects around the globe \u2013 including 54 solar rooftops \u2013 we are making significant progress towards reaching Amazon\u2019s company-wide commitment to reach 100% renewable energy by 2030.\u201d\n\u201cAgreements like this Power Purchase Agreement speak volumes about the levels of confidence from major employers and businesses across all sectors in Scotland\u2019s renewable energy infrastructure,\u201d said Paul Wheelhouse, MSP, Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Scotland. \u201cIn 2018, Scotland was able to achieve a record level of renewable energy generation, with revised data showing that 76.3% of Scotland\u2019s electricity demand was met from renewable sources, and onshore wind energy alone was capable of meeting more than 50% of Scotland\u2019s gross electricity demand. These fantastic figures illustrate the importance of onshore wind in our current energy mix, as a highly cost effective source of generation, but also the leading role it will play in meeting our future energy needs, too.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by Amazon is another important step for North Carolina\u2019s clean energy plan that will increase our reliance on renewables and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. \u201cNot only is this the right thing to do for our planet, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our economy. More clean energy jobs means better jobs for North Carolina families.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the announcement of these new projects, helping bring more clean energy to the Commonwealth of Virginia where Amazon is already recognized as a leader in bringing renewable energy projects online,\u201d said Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. \u201cThese solar farms help reaffirm the Commonwealth's role as a leading producer of clean energy in the U.S., helping take the nation forward in responding to climate change.\u201d\n\u201cI applaud Amazon\u2019s continued leadership in the Commonwealth and commitment to sustainability,\u201d said Congressman Donald McEachin. \u201cRenewable energy projects like the Fort Powhatan solar farm will make our communities safer and healthier while creating the advanced energy jobs that are essential to helping us address climate change.\u201d\nTo track progress toward these goals, Amazon launched a new sustainability website to report on its sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance. The site includes information on Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics that share the progress the company is making towards reaching The Climate Pledge. The new goals, commitments, investments, and programs build on Amazon\u2019s long-term commitment to sustainability through existing innovative programs, including Shipment Zero \u2013 Amazon\u2019s vision to make all shipments net zero carbon, with 50% net zero carbon by 2030; sustainable packaging initiatives like Frustration-Free Packaging and Ship in Own Container, which have reduced packaging waste by 25% since 2015; renewable energy programs; investments in the circular economy with the Closed Loop Fund; and numerous other initiatives happening every day by teams across Amazon.\nVisit https:\/\/sustainability.aboutamazon.com\/ to view the company\u2019s new sustainability report and learn more.\nAbout Amazon\n Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"New facility will total more than one million square feet and create 500 new, full-time jobs\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 26, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open a fulfillment center in Deltona, Florida, creating more than 500 new, full-time jobs with industry-leading pay of an hour and up, and comprehensive benefits starting on day one. Employees at the more than one million-square-foot fulfillment center will pick, pack and ship large customer items, such as sports equipment, patio furniture, fishing rods, pet food, kayaks, bicycles, and larger household goods.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue our investment in Florida and further expand our presence in the state with this new fulfillment center in Deltona,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global customer fulfillment. \u201cSince 2013, Amazon has invested more than in Florida through local fulfillment centers and cloud infrastructure, research facilities, and compensation to thousands of employees in the state.\u201d\nAmazon has created more than 13,500 full-time jobs in Florida since first launching fulfillment operations in the Sunshine State in 2013. Currently, Amazon operates facilities in Orlando, Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville.\n\u201cI applaud Amazon for this newest fulfillment center and their continued investment in Florida,\u201d said Governor Ron DeSantis. \u201cAmazon is proving that by investing in modern supply chains, consumers are well-served, environmental impacts are minimized, and infrastructure is best utilized. I look forward to the positive impacts this center will have on Volusia County.\u201d\n\u201cDeltona\u2019s strategic location along the I-4 Corridor will serve Amazon well, and hosting Amazon telegraphs the fact that Deltona is open for business,\u201d said Mayor Heidi Herzberg. \u201cAnalysis of the site confirms it as a prime location. And Amazon\u2019s selection of the site represents great employment and economic development opportunities for Deltona, its residents and neighboring communities.\u201d\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match, starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families.\nIn addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs. All associates at the Deltona center will go through hours of safety training and have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs such as Career Choice. In this program, the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in disciplines such as game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\n\"Amazon brings more than a major fulfillment center to Volusia County,\" said Dr. Charles Duva, Chairman of Team Volusia Economic Development Corporation and Co-founder and Chairman of DuvaSawko, one of the community's leading employers. \"Amazon brings a dynamic global brand to the community along with state-of-the-art systems that will support the company's growth as we move further into the 21st century.\"\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based in Florida. There are more than 139,000 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Florida growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services.\nThe project is being developed by Seefried Industrial Properties.\nTo learn more about working at an Amazon fulfillment center, visit www.amazondelivers.jobs.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

{"raw_text":"New AWS Europe (Spain) Region will arrive in next several years, enabling customers to run workloads and store data in Spain and serve end-users with even lower latency\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 31, 2019-- Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced it will open an infrastructure region in Spain. The new AWS Europe (Spain) Region will consist of three Availability Zones at launch, and will be AWS\u2019s seventh region in Europe, joining existing regions in Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm, and the upcoming Milan region launching in early 2020. The Spain Region is expected to open late 2022 or early 2023. Currently, AWS provides 69 Availability Zones across 22 infrastructure regions worldwide. With this announcement, AWS now has announced plans for 13 more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain. For more information on AWS\u2019s global infrastructure, go to: https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/about-aws\/global-infrastructure\/\n\u201cCloud computing is already powering innovation within businesses, educational institutions, public administrations, and government agencies across Spain, and with this AWS infrastructure region, we look forward to helping accelerate this transformation,\u201d said Peter DeSantis, Vice President of Global Infrastructure and Customer Support, Amazon Web Services. \u201cOpening an AWS Region in Spain will drive more technology jobs and businesses, boosting the local economy, while enabling organizations across all industries to lower costs, increase security, and improve agility. We\u2019re excited to have AWS contribute to the future growth of Spain.\u201d\nAWS\u2019s announcement was welcomed by Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who described it as great news for the country. \"This investment from AWS will allow Spain to fully adapt to the digital transformation and develop as an international center of innovation and technology. Cloud computing, in addition to promoting technological progress in the private sector, will enable the Public Administration to improve the services it provides to citizens. A secure cloud is an essential tool for the development of our economy, as well as for the generation of jobs in our country. We highly value AWS's commitment to the technological development of Spain and the upskilling of our citizens.\"\nThe addition of the AWS Europe (Spain) Region will enable local customers with data residency requirements to store their content in Spain, with the assurance that they retain complete control over the location of their data, while customers building applications that comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will have access to another secure AWS infrastructure region in the European Union (EU) that meets the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection. Today, AWS is also Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS) High certified, meaning its infrastructure meets the highest levels of security and compliance for government agencies and public organizations in Spain. This all gives Spanish organizations from startups to enterprises and the public sector access to infrastructure in their country to leverage advanced technologies including analytics, artificial Intelligence, database, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, mobile services, serverless, and more to drive innovation.\nAWS continues to grow and invest in Spain\nThe news of the upcoming AWS Europe (Spain) Region adds to AWS\u2019s ongoing investment in the country. AWS first established a presence in the country in 2012, with the launch of an AWS Edge location in Madrid. This was followed by an AWS office in the city in 2014, which has a significant and growing team of account managers, business development managers, customer services representatives, partner managers, professional services consultants, solutions architects, technical account managers, and many more to help customers of all sizes as they move to the cloud. In 2016, AWS launched its first AWS Direct Connect location, allowing customers to establish a dedicated network connection from their on-premises data centers to AWS. In 2017, AWS delivered an additional Edge location and AWS Direct Connect location in Madrid. AWS has also had a presence in Barcelona since 2018, where a vibrant startup ecosystem thrives and leverages AWS to innovate faster. These investments were made to support the rapid growth of AWS in Spain and around the world.\nCustomers and partners looking to learn more about AWS in Spain should visit aws.amazon.com\/es\/local\/spain.\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

The two companies will work together to accelerate Ring\u2019s mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods with affordable, effective home security products and services, so more customers can see, hear, and speak to people on their property from anywhere.\n\u201cOur mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods has been at the core of everything we do at Ring,\u201d said Jamie Siminoff, CEO and Chief Inventor of Ring. \u201cTogether with Amazon, we will accelerate our mission dramatically by connecting more neighbors globally and making our security devices and systems more affordable and accessible. The entire Ring team is excited to continue working hard to create products and services that bring real benefits to people\u2019s lives and build safer communities for all our neighbors.\u201d\nTo kick start this commitment, Amazon and Ring have dropped the price of the popular Ring Video Doorbell to , making home security more accessible than ever to customers. Ring\u2019s Video Doorbell has been effective in reducing burglaries in neighborhoods by as much as 55 percent, according to an LAPD pilot program. Now, with Amazon\u2019s aim to deliver premium products at non-premium prices, the two companies can help make peace of mind at home a reality for more neighbors than ever before.\n\u201cRing\u2019s talented team has invented home security products and services that customers love. We\u2019re excited about their work, their products and their mission, and look forward to teaming together to keep delighting customers,\u201d said Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices and Services. \u201cAnd this is just the beginning\u2014we will continue to move quickly and work hard to empower customers with a suite of security solutions that provide an affordable, effective way to secure homes and neighborhoods.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s relationship with Ring began in 2016 through the Alexa Fund, the company\u2019s investment arm to support companies with cutting-edge technologies that are innovating with voice. The investment provided a strong foundation for Ring to be able to lean into new Alexa APIs and capabilities, and develop a new Alexa skill that allows customers to use voice to view camera feeds directly from Echo Show and Fire TV.\nNeighbors experience the power and impact of the Ring Video Doorbell every day. Ring has contributed to keeping neighborhoods and neighbors safer\u2014from helping people with disabilities more easily see who\u2019s at the door and respond, to helping prevent activities like package theft or home burglaries.\nCustomers can now choose from a large selection of home security products, cameras, and solutions under the Amazon umbrella, including:\nRing, Blink, and Amazon Cloud Cam will continue operations under their respective brands. Customers will not experience any interruption in service and can contact the appropriate company\u2019s customer service team with any questions or issues.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"New 645,000 square-foot site in the city of Bondurant to create 1,000 new, full-time jobs\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 6, 2020-- Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open its first fulfillment center in the state of Iowa in the city of Bondurant. The site, which is anticipated to launch in late 2020, will create 1,000 new full-time jobs with industry leading pay and comprehensive benefits starting on day one.\n\u201cWe are delighted to be opening our first Iowa fulfillment center in the city of Bondurant and look forward to creating 1,000 new, full-time jobs with Amazon\u2019s minimum wage and industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global customer fulfillment. \u201cThe site will help us continue to serve customers with great delivery options and we appreciate the strong support from local and state leaders.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s announcement is jet-fuel for Iowa\u2019s future. Amazon\u2019s investment in East Polk County, and the Bondurant community ushers in a new era of innovation, with lasting benefits for employees, our citizens, our local businesses, and our state. Bondurant\u2019s partnership with Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center will spark growth for Main Street entrepreneurs, builds on Iowa\u2019s high standard of living, and will improve hometown quality of life for families across Iowa,\u201d noted Senator Zach Nunn (R-Bondurant).\nAt the new 645,000 square-foot fulfillment center employees will work alongside Amazon robotics to pick, pack and ship small items to customers such as books, electronics and toys.\n\u201cThe city of Bondurant has seen tremendous growth and success over the last decade. Today\u2019s announcement by Amazon will add another chapter to our city\u2019s story. This is great news for the hundreds of Iowans who will be employed at the fulfillment center as well as the people of Bondurant,\u201d noted State Representative Brian Lohse.\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families.\n\u201cThe city of Bondurant is excited to welcome and work with Amazon, who is creating more than 1,000 jobs in our region,\u201d said Curt Sullivan, Mayor of Bondurant. \u201cAmazon\u2019s investment in our community will have significant impact throughout the greater Des Moines region. This project supports the City\u2019s vision to enhance economic development opportunities and diversify employment options. It also enables the City to upgrade the public infrastructure improvements around this site for the betterment of our community members. The investments and the jobs coming to Bondurant will enhance our ability to support future public improvements and spur additional economic development.\u201d\n\u201cWe are honored to be a part of the team that brought Amazon to Bondurant. Their investment in Eastern Polk county solidifies our area as a logistics hub. Amazon\u2019s leadership will create a positive impact for jobs and culture in Central Iowa,\u201d said Alex Lynch, Executive Director of East Polk Innovation Collaborative (EPIC).\nAmazon has also pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.\n\"We are excited that Amazon is establishing a highly advanced robotic sortation center in Bondurant. Amazon's project in Iowa further demonstrates the region is a logistics and technology hub and adds to the presence of other major tech companies with operations here,\" said Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership. \"This project shows that Iowa continues to be recognized nationally as a top place for businesses to relocate or expand.\"\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Donates $2 Million to Seattle-Based Nonprofits to Expand Access to STEM and Computer Science Education for Hundreds of Thousands of Students from Underserved and Underrepresented Communities Across Washington State\nAmazon is donating to Washington STEM \u2013 to support their work in making STEM more accessible, equitable, and meaningful for every Washington student, especially those furthest from opportunity \u2013 and to Pacific Science Center \u2013 to develop a new computer science curriculum and expand outreach to 200,000 students in low-income communities\nThe donation is part of Amazon Future Engineer \u2013 a childhood to career program aimed at expanding computer science access to more students from underserved and underrepresented communities across the country\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2020-- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced a total donation to two Washington nonprofit organizations working to make STEM and computer science education more accessible, equitable, and meaningful for hundreds of thousands of Washington State students, especially those from underserved and underrepresented communities. The donation includes to Washington STEM, a statewide nonprofit organization that advances excellence, innovation and equity in STEM for all Washington students, and to the Pacific Science Center (PacSci), a nonprofit focused on igniting curiosity and enabling access to science education.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to support more hard-working, curious students by helping improve equitable access to STEM and computer science education in our home state of Washington,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cWe are excited to work with Washington STEM and PacSci \u2013 leaders in STEM and computer science education \u2013 as they work to create the resources, access, and innovative opportunities Washington students need to build their best futures, from Seattle to Spokane.\u201d\nWashington STEM will use the gift to support their work to ensure all students, regardless of skin color, income, or gender, have access to the education and opportunities that will help them thrive in family-wage careers in Washington State. The funds will help fill systems-level gaps\u2014from childhood-to-career\u2014specifically focused on students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, students living in rural areas, and girls and young women.\nPacSci will use the gift to grow Science On Wheels (SOW), its flagship outreach program that builds excitement for science, technology, engineering, and math through interactive workshops, live stage shows, and portable exhibits in schools, libraries, and community centers throughout Washington State. PacSci will increase the number of students that SOW serves in low-income Title I schools. PacSci will also add a computer science curriculum to go along with the existing curriculums, which will teach core concepts and key practices in computational thinking.\n\u201cBy 2030, 70 percent of all Washington jobs offering a family wage will require education beyond high school in the form of certificates, apprenticeships, two-year and four-year degrees. Two-thirds of these jobs will require STEM skills,\u201d said Angela Jones, CEO, Washington STEM. \u201cBut when you look at the data, only 40 percent of our state\u2019s youth are on track to obtain the education they\u2019ll need to access these STEM careers. Amazon\u2019s investment will help close the gaps we know exist \u2013 create access for students of color, rural students, students from low-income backgrounds, and young women \u2013 and help put Washington students on pathways to Washington jobs.\u201d\n\u201cPacific Science Center is committed to providing everyone with access to experiences that cultivate curiosity, discovery, experimentation, and critical thinking,\u201d said Will Daugherty, president and CEO, Pacific Science Center. \u201cScience On Wheels has delivered high-quality science education throughout the state of Washington for almost 50 years. With Amazon\u2019s investment and ongoing partnership, Science On Wheels will have more impact than ever, especially in the schools and communities where resources are most scarce. We look forward to working together to serve students, families, and schools in this region.\u201d\n\u201cGiving our students access to a modern STEM education will lead them to rich, successful and meaningful careers in Washington\u2019s modern economy,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Wellman (D-Mercer Island). \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Washington STEM and the Pacific Science Center for providing these educational opportunities and to Amazon for providing funding to help these organizations expand and grow.\u201d\nWashington STEM is a statewide nonprofit organization working in partnership with ten regional STEM Networks and statewide partners to increase equitable access to STEM education and opportunity. Washington STEM has a long-term vision of increasing equitable access from childhood-to-career with a focus on students of color, students living in rural areas, and students from low-income backgrounds. Through their Early STEM initiative, Washington STEM is supporting teachers, families, and caregivers in engaging more frequently and directly with children in math \u2013 giving students the best start possible in school and life. Through their Career Pathways initiative, Washington STEM is working with business, education, and community partners to expose and prepare students for exciting careers in tech, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, construction, maritime and other high-demand industries in which STEM fuels innovation, economic mobility and job growth.\nPacSci\u2019s mission is to ignite curiosity and fuel a passion for discovery, experimentation, and critical thinking. Their award-winning, interactive programs serve nearly 1 million people each year throughout the state of Washington in their communities, in classrooms, at the Mercer Slough Environmental Education Center in Bellevue, and at its seven-acre campus at Seattle Center. PacSci is deeply committed to expanding access to science for traditionally underrepresented and underserved children and families. During the 2018-19 school year, PacSci\u2019s Science On Wheels outreach program served more than 115,000 students in 31 of Washington\u2019s 39 counties. More than 60,000 of these students were in Title I schools in low-income communities.\nAmazon is committed to bringing more resources to children and young adults to help them build their best future. Amazon has invested more than to increase access to computer science\/STEM education and has donated more than to organizations that promote computer science\/STEM education across the country. Amazon\u2019s primary computer science access program, Amazon Future Engineer, is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to try computer science. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer aims to inspire hundreds of thousands of young people to explore computer science; awards dozens of schools Amazon Future Engineer Robotics Grants, provides over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; awards 100 students with four-year scholarships, as well as offers guaranteed and paid Amazon internships to gain work experience, and forms unique partnerships with trusted institutions to bring new coding experiences to students. There are currently more than 40 high schools across Washington State that are part of the Amazon Future Engineer high school program, and three Washington State students won our Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship last year. There are more than 30 schools in Washington who received the Amazon Future Engineer Robotics grant.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"New Amazon funding covers FIRST program for 21 Metro Nashville Public Schools to start robotics teams; for each school to provide computer science education field trips, hardware, and technology upgrades; and a tour of an Amazon robotics fulfillment center\nAmazon to fund computer science courses in Tennessee high schools \u2013 with classes to start in 3 Metro Nashville schools and more than 45 across the state\nDonation is part of Amazon Future Engineer, a four-part, childhood-to-career program that works to inspire and educate millions of children and young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities to try computer science\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 11, 2019-- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Metro Nashville Public Schoolstoday announced a new partnership to bring computer science courses and robotics to 24 schools supporting students from underserved or underrepresented communities, as part of the Amazon Future Engineer program. Amazon is providing 21 elementary, middle and high schools with robotics programming, which includes funding to launch FIRST robotics clubs along with teacher professional development, to expand access to computer science education at each school, which could include field trips, hardware, and technology upgrades, and access to a tour of an Amazon robotics fulfillment center. In addition, Amazon also plans to fund Intro and AP computer science courses in three Metro Nashville high schools and more than 45 total high schools across the state of Tennessee, benefitting more than 1,000 local students.\n\u201cWe are excited to team with Metro Nashville Public Schools to help more local students, especially those from underserved and underrepresented communities, develop the skills they need to build their best future,\u201d said Dave Clark, Amazon SVP, Worldwide Operations. \u201cAmazon Future Engineer will help students have positive, early, and frequent interactions with computer science so that they can become the innovators of tomorrow at Amazon or beyond - and continue to strengthen the economy and community of Nashville.\u201d\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a tiny minority from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\n\u201cWe are always looking for new ways to teach our students, and we are elated that Amazon is bringing some of its brightest minds and most innovative resources to our MNPS classrooms,\u201d said Dr. Adrienne Battle, interim Director of Schools.\nThe FIRST robotics programs will be brought to Metro Nashville Public Schools Magnet STEAM schools. These schools focus on science, technology, engineering, art and math, linking those disciplines to life skills that reach far beyond the classroom. The Magnet Schools focus on diversity, innovative curriculums, professional development, academic excellence, and partnerships \u2013 such as this new partnership with Amazon.\nThe mission of FIRST is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills to students in grades K-12. Data from a 5-year longitudinal study of FIRST by Brandeis University shows competitive FIRST robotics programs works for all youth. Across all demographic groups (gender, race, economic status and geography), FIRST students show significant gains in STEM knowledge, STEM interest, STEM career interest, STEM identity, and STEM activity compared to their peers who don\u2019t participate. FIRST students are more likely to major in tech-focused science fields in college; by their second year of college, over 50 percent declare majors in engineering or technology. The impact on young women in FIRST is particularly profound. By their first year of college, female alumnae of FIRST are 3.6 times more likely to take an engineering course, and 1.9 times more likely to take a computer science course than female comparison students.\nThe Amazon Future Engineer high schools will receive funding from Amazon to offer Intro & AP computer science courses. Amazon\u2019s funding also provides preparatory lessons, tutorials, professional development for teachers, fully sequenced and paced digital curriculum for students, and live online support every day of the week for both teachers and students. All students participating in this program will receive a free membership to AWS Educate, which provides them with free access to computing power in the AWS Cloud for their coding projects and content to learn about cloud computing.\nLaunched in November 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer aims to inspire millions of kids to explore computer science; provides over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; awards 100 students with four-year scholarships, as well as offers guaranteed and paid Amazon internships to gain work experience. Amazon Future Engineer is part of Amazon\u2019s investment in computer science\/STEM education. In addition, Amazon Future Engineer has donated more than to organizations that promote computer science\/STEM education across the country.\nAmazon is already working with Middle Tennesseans to bring 5,000 new jobs in downtown Nashville over the coming months and years. Amazon Nashville will serve as the eastern U.S. hub for Amazon\u2019s retail operations business, and will include tech and management teams working on customer fulfillment, customer service, transportation, supply chain management, and similar activities. Tennessee, Davidson County and the city of Nashville will benefit from in new tax revenues over the next 10 years as a result of Amazon\u2019s investment and job creation. Since announcing its move to Nashville, Amazon has donated to Tennessee State University to endow a professorship in computer science, to Communities in Schools to support local public schools, to Project Return, an organization dedicated to the successful new beginnings of people who are returning to the community after incarceration, and to The Store, a year-round free grocery store allowing people to shop for their basic needs.\nThe schools participating in Amazon Future Engineer within MNPS include:\nSchools, teachers, students, and parents can visit www.AmazonFutureEngineer.com to apply or to learn more information about the program.\nAbout Amazon in the Community\nAmazon is committed to helping more children and young adults, especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities, have the resources and skills they need to build their best future.

{"raw_text":"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 18, 2018-- (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u2014 Amazon today announced an expansion of its Toronto Tech Hub and plans to create 600 new tech jobs in fields including software development, machine learning, cloud computing, digital advertising, and artificial intelligence. To accommodate the company\u2019s continued growth in Ontario, Amazon has opened a new 113,000 square foot office in Scotia Plaza in downtown Toronto, owned by KingSett Capital and AIMCo. Amazon currently has more than 800 corporate employees in Toronto, primarily focused on research and software development for customer fulfillment technology, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Alexa, as well as business development for Amazon Advertising and AWS.\n\u201cAmazon is excited to create hundreds of new highly-skilled jobs in Toronto,\" said Tamir Bar-Haim, Amazon\u2019s Toronto Site Lead and Head of Amazon Advertising in Canada. \"Toronto has a well-educated and diverse workforce, and there\u2019s a real culture of innovation here. We look forward to continuing to invent for our customers in Canada and globally, and welcoming top-tier talent to fill exciting roles across Amazon.\u201d\n\"Amazon's long-term commitment to our province is a vote of confidence in our skilled workforce and competitive business environment,\" said Ontario Premier Doug Ford. \"It sends a clear signal to the world that Ontario is Open for Business.\"\n\u201cCanada is recognized globally as a leader in the innovation economy, and Amazon\u2019s expansion of its Toronto tech hub is proof that Canada\u2019s talented and skilled workforce has what it takes to compete and succeed. We welcome Amazon\u2019s investment in Toronto and the jobs they have created all across Canada,\u201d said Bill Morneau, Minister of Finance & Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s expansion of its Toronto Tech Hub underscores the incredible tech talent we have in our city, and jobs like these allow us to retain and attract high tech talent locally,\u201d said Toronto Mayor John Tory. \u201cThank you Amazon for choosing to grow in Toronto, and we look forward to working with you as a key partner in Toronto\u2019s innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s Toronto Tech Hub is one of the company\u2019s 18 Tech Hubs outside Seattle in North America, which together employ more than 20,000 people building new products and services for Amazon customers. The Toronto-based teams support the company\u2019s global logistics and operations network by creating cutting-edge technology to enhance the delivery experience for customers. Additionally, the AWS team enables customers in the Greater Toronto Area including the Art Gallery of Ontario, Flynn Group of Companies, The Globe and Mail, Porter Airlines, theScore, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Toronto Star, to build in the cloud.\nAmazon continues to invest heavily across Canada. With this expansion in Toronto, Amazon has this year alone announced plans to create more than 6,000 new jobs in Canada, across new corporate offices in Vancouver and Toronto and four new customer fulfillment centers in Ottawa, Caledon, Tsawwassen First Nation, and Edmonton. These new job opportunities are for candidates with all types of experience, education, and skill levels\u2014from engineers and cloud computing specialists to those seeking entry-level positions and on-the-job training. Amazon now has more than 10,000 employees in Canada, across its Toronto and Vancouver Tech Hubs, the AWS infrastructure region in the Montreal area, and customer fulfillment facilities in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. Since 2011, Amazon has invested more than CAD $3 billion in Canada, including customer fulfillment and cloud infrastructure, research facilities, and compensation to our employees.\nBuilding the future together in Canada\nNamed #4 on LinkedIn\u2019s 2018 Top Companies list for Canadian employers, Amazon provides comprehensive benefits to its employees, from the company\u2019s most senior executives to its hourly associates \u2013 including highly-competitive pay, benefits, and a group RRSP plan. Amazon's customer fulfillment associates can also take advantage of its innovative Career Choice program, which pays 95 percent of the cost of tuition to pursue continuing education courses in in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. To date, more than 16,000 Amazonians globally have used the job-retraining program. Some of the most popular areas in Canada include computer programming, information technology, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, as part of the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to the communities where our employees live and work, the Amazon Future Engineer program recently donated CAD $525,000 to Canada Learning Code to help inspire students of diverse backgrounds\u2014especially women and underrepresented groups\u2014to pursue careers in the technology sector. Amazon is also working to expand its AWS Educate initiative globally. More than 50 Canadian institutions, including Ryerson University and the University of Toronto, are accelerating the education and training of the next generation of IT and cloud professionals through AWS Educate.\n With more than 610,000 employees worldwide, Amazon ranks first on Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies, second in Fortune's World Most Admired Companies, and first on The Harris Poll's Corporate Reputation survey.

With the investments we\u2019re making, we are giving small businesses around the globe powerful tools and technology to help them reach hundreds of millions of customers and build successful brands.\u201d\nTools such as Target Inventory Levels, Inventory Performance Index, and the Inventory Performance Dashboard help sellers leverage Prime Free One-Day Delivery and reach more customers with their products.

Amazon Future Engineer offers 100 current high school seniors from underserved and underrepresented communities across the country the opportunity to receive scholarships to study computer science at a four-year college or university and a guaranteed paid internship offer at Amazon after the completion of their first year. Scholarships will be awarded based on academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, community involvement, work experience, future goals, and financial need. Students can apply at amazonfutureengineer.com through January 17.\n\u201cI had the pleasure of meeting Leo Jean-Baptiste from the first class of Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship recipients this past year,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cHis story, which continues now at Stanford, has me even more excited for a new group of curious, creative, and hard-working students to apply for this unique and game-changing opportunity.\u201d\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a small percentage from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.\n\u201cTo say that being selected as an Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship recipient changed my life is an understatement,\u201d said Jessica Bradley, 2019 Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship winner and current freshman at Georgia Tech. \u201cTo be ensured financial stability during my undergraduate education, to be guaranteed a software engineering internship after my freshman year, and to have the opportunity to study what I am most passionate about are just a few of the things I am grateful for, all thanks to the Amazon Future Engineer program.\u201d\n\u201cI was thrilled when my student, Jessica, found out she won the Amazon Future Engineer scholarship,\u201d said Jill Westerlund, teacher at Hoover High School in Hoover, Alabama. \u201cI always encourage my students to dream big, and pursuing this opportunity with Amazon is about as big as it gets. It\u2019s life-changing.\u201d\nThe inaugural class of Amazon Future Engineer Scholars includes 100 high school seniors from 32 states across the country. All of the recipients demonstrated financial need and more than half of the students are from an underrepresented group in the computer science field. These 100 students are currently attending some of the top computer science programs in the country.\nCurrent high school seniors are encouraged to apply starting today at amazonfutureengineer.com. All applications are due by January 17.

{"raw_text":"FINRA CAT and AWS team up to streamline and secure tracking of more than 100 billion daily financial market events from 22 stock exchanges and 1,500 broker dealer firms\nFINRA CAT will ultimately help protect investors by improving the ability of regulators to oversee trading in the U.S. securities markets\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 4, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that FINRA CAT, LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), has selected AWS as its cloud provider for the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). The CAT will allow regulators to improve securities market surveillance by creating an extensive audit trail of order information for all U.S. equity securities and listed options across U.S. markets and trading venues. Leveraging AWS\u2019s storage, compute, database, analytics, and security services, CAT ingests more than 100 billion market events per day, pulling together data from 22 stock exchanges and 1,500 broker dealer firms, enabling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) to analyze CAT data.\nFINRA CAT, as the CAT Plan Processor, is responsible for building and managing the CAT platform. This platform will be the repository for all equities and listed options transaction data in the U.S. and will track market trading activity by following orders throughout their life cycle. FINRA CAT is relying on the breadth and depth of the AWS portfolio, including Amazon Aurora (for its primary database needs) and Amazon Redshift (for data warehousing), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), as well as AWS\u2019s unparalleled security and compliance capabilities to develop the platform. With Amazon EMR, which allows users to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively at scale, and Amazon Redshift, which makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3, the CAT will be able to provide insights on market trading activities to SROs and the SEC so that they can identify anomalies in market data in order to better detect and prosecute illegal market activity and protect investors. The CAT will be the first-ever repository of all equity and listed options data for regulatory compliance purposes, leveraging AWS security capabilities such as AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS CloudTrail in order to ensure the security of sensitive financial data.\n\u201cWe are responsible for providing regulators with a consolidated view of the markets, so security, scalability, and resiliency are at the forefront of the design for the CAT platform,\u201d said Scott Donaldson, FINRA CAT Chief Technology Officer. \u201cFINRA has deep and tested experience in creating such an environment on AWS, and in view of that track record, FINRA CAT is pleased to select AWS for this major project.\u201d\n\"The CAT will provide a single comprehensive view of U.S equities and listed options markets, as well as new tools to reconstruct market activity and maintain fair and orderly trading systems,\" said Teresa Carlson, Vice President, Worldwide Public Sector at AWS. \u201cTo implement this important regulatory initiative, FINRA CAT chose AWS to deliver a highly scalable, robust, and secure system that will enable regulators to improve securities market analysis. We are collaborating to ensure that FINRA CAT can deliver an industry leading platform that provides accessibility and transparency of capital markets data to protect investors and the integrity of the financial market.\u201d\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 69 Availability Zones (AZs) within 22 geographic regions, with announced plans for 13 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain. Millions of customers\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Studios Also Announces First Look Deal with Critical Role to Develop New Series to Premiere Exclusively on Prime Video\nCULVER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 5, 2019-- (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2014 Amazon Prime Video, along with Critical Role, today announced the service will be the exclusive streaming home for the upcoming animated series Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina, based on the adventures and characters of Critical Role, a leading story-driven and world-building digital media brand. Amazon Studios has ordered two seasons of the series and has also closed a first-look deal with Critical Role to develop new series to premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. This content agreement builds on the long-standing engagement Critical Role has had with Amazon\u2019s live-streaming service Twitch, where they have broadcast their wildly successful live role-playing show since 2015.\nEarlier this year, Critical Role launched The Legend of Vox Machina as a Kickstarter campaign for a 22-minute animated special produced by Titmouse, reaching their original funding goal within minutes. The campaign continued to gain traction thanks to Critical Role\u2019s passionate fanbase, becoming the most-funded TV, film or animated project in Kickstarter history and raising over , enough to fund a 10-episode season. With this new agreement, Prime Video will build on that record-breaking support, ordering an additional 14 episodes, for a total of 24 episodes across two seasons, to stream exclusively on the service.\nCritical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina follows a group of second-rate, drunken adventurers on a quest to save the realm from terrifying monsters and dark magical forces, only to discover they become a found family in the process. It's an adult animated action-comedy series in the fantasy universe of, and starring original characters from, Critical Role.\n\u201cWe were absolutely floored by the level of enthusiasm we received on the Kickstarter campaign, and now we can deliver exactly what the fans wanted, and MORE,\u201d said Sam Riegel and Travis Willingham, cast members of Critical Role and executive producers on the series. \u201cTeaming with Prime Video to deliver the series to fans across the globe is exciting and surreal -- and we\u2019re psyched to be able to tell even more stories with not just one, but two 12-episode seasons!\u201d\n\u201cCritical Role blazed a new trail for original digital content, with fresh new voices and humor that earned devoted fans around the world, as evidenced by their wildly successful Kickstarter campaign,\u201d said Jennifer Salke, Head of Amazon Studios. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to work with the whole team to bring The Legend of Vox Machina, and new Critical Role series, to our Prime Video customers.\u201d\nChris Prynoski, Titmouse president and founder added, \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to make an animated show based on fantasy role playing games since I was 1st level. I\u2019m overjoyed for Titmouse to join the Critical Role adventuring party to slay this beast alongside the mighty Amazon army!\u201d\nCritical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina stars the Critical Role cast of Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Liam O\u2019Brien, Matthew Mercer, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham, who are reprising their roles; they will also serve as executive producers, alongside Brandon Auman (Star Wars: Resistance) and Chris Prynoski (Metalocalypse), with Sung Jin Ahn (Niko and the Sword of Light) joining as supervising director. Emmy award-winning studio Titmouse is the animation partner. Critical Role is represented by CAA, who helped broker the deal.\nWhen we meet the members of Vox Machina in Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina, they\u2019re a rowdy, ragtag assortment of swords and wands-for-hire. Seven wandering dumbasses who care more about easy money and cheap ale than actually protecting the realm. But when their home city of Emon is attacked by a horrific monster, they realize they are the only ones capable of avenging their neighbors and restoring justice. United as Protectors of the Realm, we follow Vox Machina as they venture beyond the walls of Emon to battle even darker forces across the kingdom. Throughout the first season of Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina, they will face undead giants, help overthrow a sinister necromancer, and confront a powerful curse that has taken root inside their own group. Through it all, they learn how to function as a team, and discover they\u2019re much more than that: they\u2019re family.\nCritical Role is the most popular story-driven and world-building digital media brand in the world. What started in 2012 as a roleplaying game between friends has evolved into a multiplatform entertainment phenomenon with a variety of shows, including the flagship show Critical Role, comic books, graphic novels, animation, live performances, podcasts, fan art and more. A passionate and engaged community tunes in each week to watch their favorite storytellers take on new adventures led by veteran voice actor Matthew Mercer and composed of other well-known voice actors Ashley Johnson, Marisha Ray, Taliesin Jaffe, Travis Willingham, Sam Riegel, Laura Bailey and Liam O'Brien.

{"raw_text":"Europe\u2019s leading media group chooses AWS as its primary cloud provider to transform its business and accelerate the delivery of new products with AWS machine learning services\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE, Europe\u2019s leading satellite and cable broadcaster, operating television channels, digital VoD platforms and e-commerce brands, has selected AWS as its primary cloud provider. ProSiebenSat.1 is working closely with AWS to adopt cloud services within all parts of its broadcast and digital media businesses, production companies, and e-commerce platforms. With AWS, ProSiebenSat.1 is improving the time to market of new applications, and introducing advanced analytics and machine learning (ML) technologies across its organization, which is transforming the viewing experience for 45 million households across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.\nProSiebenSat.1 has a long history of working with AWS because of its deep portfolio of cloud services, high levels of security and compliance, rapid pace of innovation, and proven experience in reliably supporting millions of customers around the world. Most of ProSiebenSat.1\u2018s brands have deployed applications on AWS, including its Joyn streaming platform, offering viewers over 20,000 episodes and 55 live channels in the cloud. ProSiebenSat.1 also runs the commerce businesses of its NuCom Group, a growing e-commerce player with 10 leading portfolio companies, on AWS as well as the production business of its Red Arrow Studios, one of the world's leading creators and distributors of entertainment content.\nRecently, ProSiebenSat.1 made a corporate-wide decision to integrate AWS ML services into every aspect of its business to automate processes and develop new, personalized products. Adopting AWS ML services will enable ProSiebenSat.1 to more intelligently tailor advertising to viewers and enhance personalization and recommendations across all of its media brands. One of its most strategic projects uses Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy ML models, and AWS data analytics tools to predict the future value of an upcoming advertising slot.\nThe solution uses a deep neural network \u2014trained and deployed using Amazon SageMaker \u2013 to predict ad conversion rates based on inputs such as the slot time, genre of the TV show, and ad content. As a result, the service is able to predict, weeks in advance, how many impressions an advertisement will generate. This allows advertisers to predict who will watch their ads, helping them to make informed purchasing decisions, while simultaneously enhancing the viewer experience with ads that are more closely aligned with consumer preferences.\n\u201cProSiebenSat.1 is a leading European entertainment conglomerate with a strong commerce business and we continue to drive the ongoing transformation of the Group into a technology-and data-led company with an emphasis on growing our digital and diversified future,\u201d said Nick Thexton, Chief Technology Officer of ProSiebenSat.1. \u201cAWS is a key strategic partner who has consistently driven cloud adoption for over a decade and is still setting the pace on what cloud services can do for media businesses. By moving more of our business to AWS and incorporating AWS\u2019s ML services, we are able to enhance our agile software development practices and derive even more value from our large consumer data platforms.\u201d\n\u201cOver the past few years, media companies have been using our unmatched portfolio of cloud services to transform the delivery of content and create more personalized viewing experiences to delight audiences on every platform,\u201d said Andy Isherwood, Managing Director, Amazon Web Services EMEA. \u201cAs one of the largest and most well-respected media companies in Europe, it is exciting to see ProSiebenSat.1 embracing AWS ML services, and establishing itself as a leader in what is possible. We look forward to supporting the company on its journey to transform how it serves its customers across its media and e-commerce brands.\u201d\nFor 13 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 165 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 69 Availability Zones (AZs) within 22 geographic regions, with announced plans for 13 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain. Millions of customers\u2014including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies\u2014trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

{"raw_text":"New facility will create 500 new, full-time jobs in DeSoto County\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 18, 2019-- Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans for its second Mississippi fulfillment center, to be located in DeSoto County. The facility will create 500 new, full-time jobs starting at an hour with comprehensive benefits starting on day one.\n\u201cMississippi has proven itself to be a great place for Amazon to do business and gives us the opportunity to better serve our customers in the region,\u201d said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global customer fulfillment. \u201cWe are excited about our growth and remain committed to creating a positive economic impact in the region with job opportunities that have great pay and benefits.\u201d\nAssociates at the more than one million-square-foot fulfillment center will pick, pack and ship large customer items, such as sports equipment, patio furniture, fishing rods, pet food, kayaks, bicycles, and larger household goods.\n\u201cAmazon's decision to locate a second fulfillment center in North Mississippi is a tremendous milestone for DeSoto County and our entire state,\u201d Governor Phil Bryant said. \u201cThis announcement serves as a shining example to industry leaders around the globe that Mississippi plays to win. We offer a supportive business climate and integrated transportation network so companies with shipping needs, such as Amazon, can reach their customers in rapid time and remain a step ahead of their competition.\u201d\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families.\nIn addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company\u2019s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon. All associates will go through hours of safety training and have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon\u2019s upskilling programs such as Career Choice. In this program, the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\n\u201cIn just 10 months, Amazon has announced two Mississippi locations creating 1,300 jobs for the people of North Mississippi. Amazon's new DeSoto County location is evidence of the fact that the Mississippi team works together to support extraordinary companies, enabling them to achieve their goals in our state,\u201d said MDA Executive Director Glenn McCullough, Jr. \u201cThe Mississippi Development Authority, along with the DeSoto County Economic Development Council, DeSoto County and the DeSoto County Board of Supervisors, is proud to once again support one of the world's most innovative companies as Amazon brings another 500 career opportunities to Mississippians in DeSoto County.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based in Mississippi. There are more than 7,500 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Mississippi growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services.\nThe project is being developed by Hillwood Investment Properties.\nTo learn more about working at an Amazon fulfillment center, interested candidates can visit www.amazondelivers.jobs.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

The donation supports the Three Square Food Bank in Las Vegas and the Food Bank of Northern Nevada in Reno \u2013 both of which serve children and families in communities where Amazon has fulfillment centers.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s generous donation to support the fight against childhood hunger will help us reach deeper into our community with additional resources for children and their families,\u201d said Michelle Beck, chief development officer of Three Square Food Bank in Las Vegas. \u201cThe need is great. In Southern Nevada, one in five children lives in a home that is food insecure. With support from community partners like Amazon, we are addressing this statistic head on.\u201d\n\u201cAs Amazon continues to grow in Nevada, the company finds impactful opportunities to give back to the communities where its employees live and work,\u201d said Ashley Wedlund, Site Leader of one of Amazon\u2019s North Las Vegas fulfillment centers. \u201cIn addition to today\u2019s donation, Amazon makes frequent, in-kind product donations throughout the year. We are proud to support the amazing work these organizations do in our communities and we are grateful for their commitment to support children and families.\u201d\nAdditionally, Amazon is funding computer science classes or robotics programs in 11 Nevada high schools through Amazon Future Engineer\u2014a childhood-to-career program to inspire, educate, and propel children and young adults from underserved and underrepresented communities to build skills and start careers in computer science. Amazon has also awarded three students from Nevada the Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship award, which provides in funding to students from disadvantaged or underrepresented backgrounds to study computer science in college, and receive a guaranteed, paid internship offer at Amazon.\nAmazon has created more than 3,500 full-time jobs and invested over in Nevada since 2011, including customer fulfillment infrastructure and compensation to our employees. The company estimates that these direct investments in the state contributed more than to Nevada\u2019s economy (2011-2018) and generated an additional 4,000 indirect jobs on top of the company\u2019s direct hires. There are also more than 19,500 authors, developers, and small and medium-sized businesses in Nevada growing their businesses with Amazon.\nWith 750,000 employees worldwide, Amazon has been recognized on LinkedIn\u2019s Top Companies list for the past four years, ranked #2 in the Fortune 2017 and 2018 World\u2019s Most Admired Companies, and ranked #5 in Fast Company'sWorld\u2019s Most Innovative Companies. The company also receives a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. Amazon offers a wide range of programs to equip employees with the skills for new, in-demand jobs \u2013 from paid cloud computing apprenticeships, to Amazon Technical Academy to its innovative Career Choice initiative, which prepays 95 percent of the cost of tuition to pursue continuing education courses in in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. All these program are part of Upskilling 2025, a commitment by Amazon looking to support all employees in gaining critical skills to move into higher skill, better paying, technical or non-technical roles.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

{"raw_text":"Amazon Managed Cassandra Service provides a scalable, highly available, and managed Cassandra-compatible database service \u2013 that\u2019s serverless, too\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 3, 2019-- Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced Amazon Managed (Apache) Cassandra Service, a scalable, highly available, and fully managed database service that supports Cassandra workloads. Developers can use the same Cassandra application code, Apache 2.0 licensed drivers, and tools as they do today to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon Managed Cassandra Service and enjoy scalability, availability, and manageability without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. And, because Amazon Managed Cassandra Service is serverless, it also removes the need to provision, configure, and operate large Cassandra clusters, manually add or remove nodes, and rebalance partitions as traffic scales up or down. There are no up-front investments required to use Amazon Managed Cassandra Service, and customers only pay for the capacity they use. To learn more about Amazon Managed Cassandra Service, visit: http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/mcs.\nToday, there are many customers using AWS who have asked for help with running, scaling, and managing their Cassandra database deployments. Managing large Cassandra clusters on-premises with hundreds of terabytes of data and millions of reads and writes per second is difficult and complex. Cassandra requires specialized expertise to set up, configure, and maintain the underlying infrastructure, and a deep understanding of the entire application stack, including the Apache Cassandra open source software. Aside from scaling clusters, customers must secure, patch, and operate Cassandra. Managing and scaling Cassandra clusters requires regularly adjusting complex configuration settings, manually adding or removing nodes, and rebalancing partitions, which can adversely affect availability and performance. Most customers with variable workloads also find it challenging to scale clusters up and down, so they often end up building clusters for peak loads and incur the unnecessary cost of paying for unused capacity. And, many customers also complain that they are unable to upgrade their cluster reliably due to Cassandra\u2019s clunky rollback and debugging features, so they choose instead to run outdated versions of Cassandra.\nAmazon Managed Cassandra Service provides a scalable, highly available, and fully managed Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Managed Cassandra Service is compatible with the open-source Apache Cassandra 3.11 API, enabling customers to migrate their workloads to Amazon Managed Cassandra Service and use the same Cassandra application code, Apache 2.0 licensed drivers, and tools that they use today. Amazon Managed Cassandra Service is serverless, so customers no longer need to provision, configure, and operate large Cassandra clusters, manually add or remove nodes, and rebalance partitions as traffic scales up or down. Amazon Managed Cassandra Service provides customers with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale, and can scale tables up and down automatically based on actual application traffic, with virtually unlimited throughput and storage. Amazon Managed Cassandra Service offers on-demand capacity, so customers pay only for the resources used by the application, and in early 2020, Amazon Managed Cassandra Service will also offer provisioned capacity, allowing customers to optimize costs by specifying capacity per workload. In early 2020, customers with existing Cassandra tables running on-premises or on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) will also be able to migrate tables to Amazon Managed Cassandra Service using AWS migration tools. Amazon Managed Cassandra Service integrates with other AWS services, so customers can help secure access to their tables using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), monitor their tables using Amazon CloudWatch, and manage their encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).\n\"Customers who are running Cassandra have told us they want to spend less time scaling, patching, and managing infrastructure and more time building applications at scale,\u201d said Shawn Bice, Vice President, Databases, AWS. \u201cAmazon Managed Cassandra Service gives these customers the ability to run Cassandra without having to worry about managing the underlying hardware, and it gives them an easy way to integrate their Cassandra applications with other AWS services. Because Amazon Managed Cassandra Service is also serverless customers can stand up Cassandra clusters in minutes and scale their database up and down based on demand, so they can spend less time worrying about their clusters, and more time building the applications that impact their businesses.\u201d\nMcDonald\u2019s is one of the world\u2019s leading food service brands with more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. \u201cOur developers like using Cassandra because of its scalability and open-source, CQL API. However, managing Cassandra infrastructure is complex and requires very specialized knowledge,\u201d said Thilina Gunasinghe, Vice President of Global Technology, Architecture, and Data at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the introduction of Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service because of its ability to scale Cassandra workloads up and down easily and its compatibility with the Cassandra drivers and development tools that our developers are already familiar with.\u201d\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences. \u201cAdobe\u2019s products and services empower our customers to design and create immersive, digital interactions with their brands,\u201d said Dan Neff, Principal Architect, Adobe. \u201cWe\u2019ve used Cassandra for years to help us store and manage data for many of Adobe\u2019s applications. However, managing our Cassandra infrastructure is expensive and complex.

In this program, the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program\u2019s launch, over 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few.\nOn top of Amazon\u2019s minimum wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families.\n\u201cWest Jordan is thrilled to welcome a new Amazon fulfillment center. Amazon\u2019s decision to invest here reflects confidence in the City\u2019s business environment and excellent workforce,\u201d said Jim Riding, Mayor of West Jordan. \u201cThis project, with approximately 800 new jobs, will provide our residents with even greater opportunity to work close to home. To the folks at Amazon, thank you for selecting the City of West Jordan for this new facility. We are proud to partner with you and are encouraged by the additional growth this project will bring.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s fulfillment network supports hundreds of thousands of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment By Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based right here in Utah. There are more than 26,500 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Utah growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services. According to a report released last year, Utah has more small- and medium-sized businesses per capita selling their products on Amazon than any other state in the nation.\nThe project is being developed by Seefried Industrial Properties.\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.
