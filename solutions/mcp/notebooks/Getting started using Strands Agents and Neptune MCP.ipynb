    "  - Fully managed graph database service\n",
    "  - High availability (>99.99% availability)\n",
    "  - Security features including VPC isolation and encryption at rest\n",
    "  - Various instance and storage types available\n",
    "  - Data loading capabilities including bulk loading and streaming\n",
    "  - Provides connectivity, cluster creation, and monitoring tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Neptune Analytics\n",
    "- **Primary Purpose**: A memory-optimized graph database engine specifically designed for analytics\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Memory optimization for storing large graph datasets in memory\n",
    "  - Graph analytic algorithms library\n",
    "  - Low-latency graph queries for fast data processing\n",
    "  - Vector search capabilities within graph traversals\n",
    "  - Designed to quickly analyze large amounts of graph data in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship\n",
    "- The two services **complement** each other, with Neptune Analytics enhancing the capabilities of Neptune Database\n",
    "- Neptune Database focuses on operational graph database needs (storage, querying, management)\n",
    "- Neptune Analytics focuses on analytical processing and deriving insights from large graph datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Differences\n",
    "- **Neptune Database**: Best for transactional workloads, real-time querying, and storing graph data\n",
    "- **Neptune Analytics**: Best for analytical workloads, pattern detection, finding trends, and complex graph algorithms over large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Neptune Database is designed for storing and managing graph data with ACID compliance in a transactional environment, while Neptune Analytics is optimized for performing fast analytical operations on large graph datasets. They work together as complementary services, with analytics extending the capabilities of the base database service.\n",

    "\n",
    "The combination of Neptune, Bedrock, Strands Agents and MCP provides a consistently powerful mechanism for ingesting data into and reading data from a knowledge graph to identify common patterns, trends and information that would otherwise be difficult to navigate or locate using traditional database and RAG methods.\n",
