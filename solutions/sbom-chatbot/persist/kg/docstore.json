For details, see \nSection 2 of \u201cFraming Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common \nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM)\u201d: \nhttps://ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ntia_sbom_framing_2nd_edition_2021102 \n1_0.pdf  \n \nQ: Who should have an SBOM?  \nA: In today\u2019s world, software touches every part of our life and spans across industries, \nwith much of it built on third -party code and open source software. Anyone who is \nconcerned about better supporting their software products internally, supporting their customers, and positively differentiating themselves in the marketplace should consider \ncreating SBOMs  and providing them  to support  their customers. Over  time,  more  SBOM \nrequirements may emerge, such as the FDA\u2019s mandate for medical device \nmanufacturers in t he draft Pre -Market Guidance for Cybersecurity: \nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/119933/download .

The ability to identify vulnerabilities allows software suppliers to produce patches or provide other \nremediation options, allows consumers to apply mitigations independently of the \nsoftware supplier, and allows the identification of software that is not affected.  This \nenables focusing on the software that may be affected.  \n \nQ: In addition to vulnerability management, how can SBOMs help me?  \nA: With SBOMs, many parts of the organization \u2014 from procurement to operations \u2014 \nhave the same understanding of their software assets. The benefits of increased visibility and accountability translate into providing more reliable services to their \ncustomers. Better  visibility  into software  allows  for additional  business  advantages  such \nas consolidating assets, licensing clarity, reviewing impact of new policies and \nregulations, and responding in a timely fashion to the ever -changing business \nenvironment.  \n \nQ: How  have bills of material  and supply  chain  transparency been  helpful \nelsewhere?  \nA: Bills of Materials  and supply  chain  management  principles  have been transformative \nto the automotive industry, the food industry, and general manufacturing for decades.  \nMany of these principles were pioneered by Toyota in the 1940s and have been improved continuously  across a growing  list of industries.  A key aspect  of this revolution \nis transparency of the supply chain and knowledge of source, quality, and how to address defects efficiently. A promise of this SBOM initiative is to apply proven supply chain principles to modern software development. In fact, the financial sector has been \nexperimenting with software supply chain transparency since as early as 2013.  \n \n \nCOMMON  MISCONCEPTIONS & CONCERNS  \n \nQ: Won\u2019t  SBOMs be  a \u201croadmap to the attacker\u201d?  \nA: Theoretically,  yes. In reality,  the defensive  benefits  of transparency  far outweigh this \ncommon concern as SBOMs serve more as a \u201croadmap for the defender\u201d.

They therefore make visible potential license violations \u2014 and the awareness necessary to mitigate them.  \n \nQ: Does an SBOM enable patent or license \u201ctrolls\u201d?  \nA: See \u201cDoes an SBOM increase my exposure to license violations?\u201d above.  \n \nQ: Will SBOMs increase  my licensing costs or licensing commitments?  \nA: No. The awareness  gained by creating  an SBOM  allows  the manufacturer  to address \nunknown licensing commitments that may be lurking in your programs. This permits the manufacturer to address these issues, either through licensing fees or securing more \nfavorable licensing terms, thus avoiding fines, lawsuits, and licensing commit ments \nsuch as exposure of your proprietary code.  \n \n \n \nCREATION  \n \nQ: Who creates and maintains an SBOM?  \nA: An SBOM is created and maintained by the producers of software. \u201cProducers\u201d \nincludes  manufacturers,  suppliers,  and individual  authors.  Ideally,  producers  assemble \nSBOMs provided to them by their suppliers; in the absence of SBOM data, producers may have to generate the SBOM data for some components.  \n \nQ: What should be included in an SBOM?  \nA: An SBOM should contain some combination of the following baseline information: author  name,  supplier  name,  component  name,  version string,  component  hash,  unique \nidentifier, and relationship. Licensing, pedigree, and provenance should also be \nincluded, if available.

Can an SBOM show that hierarchy?  \nA: Yes. SBOMs  can provide hierarchical  information.  Each component  that is included in \nan SBOM should have an SBOM of its own if it also includes components. The SBOMs \nsupplied with each software component taken together represent all levels of the \nhierarchy required to sufficiently understand the software and its various parts. Such an SBOM is analogous to a manufactured product multilevel bill of materials. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials#Multi -level_BOM  \n \nQ: How deep in the dependency graph should an SBOM enumerate?  \nA: It depends  on the intended audience  and the medium  of communication.  In the case \nof a machine- readable SBOM, the minimum viable model is one layer deep with the \ngoal of recursing up the supply chain. Many use cases (e.g. the FDA Premarket Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices) would like to see it as compl ete as possible, but they understand that complete SBOMs will take time.

A \nsubsequent investigation into the impact of the disclosed vulnerability upon your \nprogram can be performed so that, if necessary, a patch can be distributed to the field before your product is ever attacked. This improves customer satisfaction and can \nimprove your position in the market.

VEX provides  additional  information  on \nwhether  a product  may be affected  by a specific  vulnerability  in software or an included \ncomponent and, if affected, whether there are actions recommended to remediate. For more information, see:  \nhttps://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/vex_one- page_summary.pdf  \n \nQ: What are some uses for VEX?  \nA: VEX provides a lot of flexibility in how it is used to communicate vulnerability information  to users.  For example,  a VEX may be used  to assert the vulnerability  status \nfor all known vulnerabilities  in a given  product.  Another  example is to communicate that \na single, high- profile vulnerability isn't applicable to a product. VEX consumers should \ncommunicate with their suppliers to understand the specific use that a particular VEX document is meant to achieve. For more information, see: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/VEX_Use_Cases_Aprill2022.pdf  \n \nQ: Does SBOM require VEX?  \nA: No. As an inventory and information layer, SBOMs have independent value supporting many use cases.

VEX documents may contain a \njustification statement of why the VEX document creator chose to assert that the product\u2019s status is NOT AFFECTED. For example, for the status justification \n\u201ccomponent_not_present\u201d, a product written in Python and Elixir does not have any \nJava code present; therefore, the product could not be affected by the Log4j vulnerability.

A VEX is an \nadvisory notice that provides context around potential vulnerabilities. VEX can use SBOM identifiers to relate vulnerability context to software components, but is not \nrequired to. While  they are designed to work  together,  VEX does  not require SBOM  and \nSBOM does not require VEX.

It focuses on the \nprocesses and mechanisms for sharing SBOMs, assuming one party has created an \nSBOM and another party wants to access it. The examples demonstrate SBOM sharing \nmethods currently in use, ranging from proprietary software vendors sharing SBOMs via email to open source projects publishing SBOMs in centralized repositories.  \nAdditionally, t his document builds upon  the \u201cSBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report ,\u201d a joint \npublication from  the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ), and the \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency \nResponse\u2019s (CESER) \u201cSBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report ,\u201d and the \u201cSBOM Sharing Roles \nand Considerations\u201d document drafted by the CISA facilitated  Sharing and Exchanging \nSBOM community -driven  workstream .

It may be helpful for the \nreader to begin with the \u201cSBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations\u201d and \u201cSBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report\u201d before delving into the practical applications of the SBOM sharing discussions in this Primer. The basis of the SBOM sharing discussion can be found in \nthose preceding documents and is not explored here. This document records methods for \nSBOM sharing currently being implemented by practitioners in the software community. This is only the first iteration of this document. Examples were gathered from members of CISA\u2019s community -driven working groups. The authors intend that this document be \nregularly updated with new methods of SBOM sharing.  \nThe examples are listed in order of sophistication\n4 of the overall SBOM sharing method \nbased on the evaluation of the Discovery, Access, and Transport phases. Organizations can use the examples offered here to understand where their SBOM sharing process is on the sophistication scale, compare other methods  of sharing SBOM, and consider other \nmethods for SBOM sharing.  \nIt is important to note that sophistication does not imply maturity or preferability. For example, publishing a publicly available SBOM for anyone to download may be a low -\nsophistication discovery method, and that could be the appropriate choice for an open source project. Furthermore, sophistication may be dependent on industry standards and \nregulations. In short, the sophistication level likely reflects priorities in the sharing context \nrather than a judgment of security maturity.  \nScope  \nThis document focuses on processes and mechanisms for sharing SBOMs. Critically, the document assumes that one party has created an SBOM and another party is interested \nin that SBOM data. Any topics regarding the quality of the SBOM, how to generate an \nSBO M, or how to utilize an SBOM after receiving it are outside the scope of this paper. \nFor guidance on what goes into an SBOM or best practices for generating SBOMs, see  \n\u201cFraming Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software Bill of \n \n1 This document was drafted by the SBOM Sharing and Exchanging Working Group, a community -\ndriven workstream.

This paper documents use cases of SBOM \nsharing among these actors.8 These examples assume that the SBOM Author or \nDistributor has an SBOM available for sharing and that the SBOM Consumer or Distributor knows what SBOM they are looking for and is able to communicate that to the appropriate parties. The sharing use cases are then evaluated in terms of benefits and \ncautions to help the reader understand the trade-offs of using a particular discovery, \naccess, or transport method.  \nFurthermore, the sophistication levels of the Discovery, Access, and Transport phases of each example are indicated to anchor the paper in the larger SBOM sharing discussion \nand analysis conducted in the \u201cSBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report\u201d and the \u201cSBOM Sharing \nRoles and Considerations\u201d documents. The six examples are organized in this paper by aggregate levels of sophistication as determined in the \u201cSBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report,\u201d with average lower levels of sophistication for Discovery, Access, and Transport at the \ntop of the paper and higher average levels of sophistication at the bottom. Arranging the \npaper by levels of sophistication does not imply an organization needs to continuously \nincrease its level of sophistication for its chosen SBOM sharing mechanism. Instead, the examples are ordered by sophistication to allow readers to identify similar SBOM- sharing \nmechanisms and consider additional methods. The paper also provides justifications for \nwhy each mechanism has been designated as sophistication Low, Medium, or High.

While these attestation registries show \ngreat promise, they are not widely adopted and are relatively immature.  In this example, an SBOM Author creates an SBOM and uploads it to an attestation \nregistry. The SBOM has unique identifiers like package URLs\n20 and Secure Hash \nAlgorithms (SHAs).  \n \nSBOM Distributors manage the federated services, which allow connections between \ncentralized and organization- specific deployments of attestation registries. Federation \nallows organization- specific deployments to pull data from centralized or supplier \ninstances while partitioning sensitive data.  \n The biggest advantage of attestation registries is not needing to know \u201cwhere\u201d to look for \nSBOMs . SBOM Consumers  are able to use unique identifiers to query the attestation \nregistry to find an SBOM and any other attestations like Supply -chain Levels for Software \nArtifacts (SLSA) Provenance.\n21 The attestation registry can also hold data for risk \nmanagement like Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange ( VEX) documents. Both package \nURLs and SHAs can be computed and do not require mapping to a source code repository or website.

Almost all suppliers are also consumers in the supply chain.  \n Tier N suppliers provide raw or basic materials and components, and represent the \nbeginning of the supply chain.\n22 Tier 3 suppliers process Tier N materials into more \nspecific but still elemental components.23 Tier 2 suppliers take those components and \nmaterials to manufacture more complex parts or systems, and thus require a combination \nof componentry from upstream suppliers. Tier 1 suppliers sell ready -for-installation \nproducts24 directly to the automaker, commonly known as the Original Equipment \nManufacturer (OEM). As the ultimate downstream supply chain participant, OEMs assemble the complete and final production vehicle, and are the final step in the supply chain.  \n \nWhile SBOM operations in the automotive industry are still in early stages of adoption, \nmany automotive companies are moving toward a consensus that SBOMs will become one of the many security and design documents that are routinely exchanged by supply chain participants. Under this scenario, a request by an automaker for an SBOM from its \nsuppliers may augment existing contractual obligations for documentation and would be \nincluded in standard information exchange agreements (e.g., non- disclosure agreement, \ncybersecurity interface agreement, development interface agreement ).  \n \nIn the example, as demonstrated by the graphic above, a Tier 3 supplier has produced an OSS library which the Tier 2 supplier has consumed, in part, to create its GPS application \nproduct. The Tier 2 automotive parts supplier has, according to contract, generated an \nSBOM internally, and then provided the SBOM to its downstream customer, the Tier 1 supplier, along with the GPS application product. At this stage of the supply chain, the Tier 2 supplier has acted as an SBOM Author. The Tier 1 supplier uses components, \nincluding those from the Tier 2 GPS application supplier, to produce the ready -for-\ninstallation infotainment system that it sells to the OEM. The Tier 1 supplier generates its \nown SBOMs for software it has produced and then bundles the upstream Tier 2 suppliers\u2019 SBOMs and its own together to make them available to OEM automakers, thereby acting as both SBOM Distributor and Author\n25.

The examples demonstrate that SBOM \nsharing is already occurring today using a variety of mechanisms that range in sophistication. As the paper indicates, there are trade- offs associated with different \nsharing approaches. More manual methods allow for greater control over access but lack scalability. Automated sharing supports discoverability and transport at scale but may \nrequire m ore sophisticated access controls. Ultimately, choosing the appropriate SBOM \nsharing mechanism will depend on factors like software licensing, industry practices, \norganizational priorities, target consumers, and risk tolerance.  \nAs SBOM adoption expands, new sharing models will emerge, especially those that \nleverage automation and standards. For example, discussion has emerged around \nmoving toward including SBOMs in end user licensing agreements for SBOM management and sharing. Key areas for continued community collaboration include consistency in SBOM formats, identifiers , and storage locations as well as transport \nprotocols and federated services. Maturation of SBOM sharing practices will be crucial to \nrealizing the full benefits  of software transparency across the entire software supply \nchain. As previously stated, this is only the first iteration of the paper . The authors intend \nfor this paper to be regularly updated with new methods of SBOM sharing as they begin \nto be used by stakeholders. Maintaining a list of SBOM sharing methods being used will serve, over time, to chronicle the progress of SBOM sharing as the practice becomes \nmore commonplace and mature.", "mimetype":

Transparency in SaaS \nEnvironments  \nExecutive Summary  \nProducers of software as a service (SaaS) should maintain Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) \ndata about their software, SaaS operators should request that data from the SaaS producers, \nand those considering subscribing to SaaS should request SBOMs from the operators. The \nbenefits of transparency for software are well documented. Software transparency allows the choosers and operators of software to make informed decisions and supports software Operators in managing risks and responding to vulnerabilities. SBOM has emerged as a key \ntool for communicating data about the components in packaged softwar e. Through an SBOM, a \nsoftware Producer can communicate information about the components and dependencies of a software instance in a machine- readable procedure. Furthermore, by generating and \nmaintaining an SBOM, Producers  signal to Operators, Chooser s, and Subscribers the maturity \nof their software security practices.   \nWhile there has been extensive work produced on the benefits of software transparency in packaged software, there remains ambiguity regarding how software transparency can be achieved for SaaS. This community -drafted white paper\n1 argues for the value of SBOM -driven \ntransparency, while identifying four key differences: (1) the frequency at which SaaS is updated; (2) the volume of software and services intertwined with SaaS; (3) the lack of definitive boundaries that determine the horizontal and vertical extent of software composition data; and (4) the opacity of SaaS systems. Using four roles (Producer, Chooser, Operator, and Subscriber), this paper discusses who could benefit from SBOM in  SaaS environments and lays \nout a path to address current challenges.  \nThe complexity of services offered through SaaS is one of the factors that limit established software transparency approaches like SBOM. In acknowledgment of the necessity for \ntransparency in SaaS services, in addition to software components, this paper pr oposes \npreliminary data fields SaaS software Producers should communicate to software Choosers and Operators.  \nIntroduction \nIn an era marked by growing cybersecurity concerns, conversations around software security have increasingly centered around transparency.

The benefits include identifying vulnerable components  or \nlibraries, risk factors, fortifying the software ecosystem against potential threats, and  extending \nbeyond security to improve efficiencies and better -align ing incentives. Much of these \ndiscussions are focused on customer -managed software, but many of these also apply to the \nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) ecosystem.  \n \nWhile many of the core concepts of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) can be applied to SaaS, \nthere are some characteristics that complicate the direct mapping. However, SaaS  is software, \nand SBOMs generally provide insights into the software itself. This paper concludes that, while \nthere are limiting factors in the efficacy of SBOMs for communicating software component data \nfor SaaS, SBOM concepts provide a valuable jumping-o ff point toward transparency for SaaS.  \nBuilding on prior work2 regarding SBOM and its role in software and supply chain transparency, \nthis community -drafted white paper examines how to map the concepts and mechanics of \nSBOM to modern online applications and also how to address the opacity of SaaS instances .3 \nIn light of the complexity of SaaS software components and services, this paper discusses software component transparency\n4 and software service5 transparency ,6 two parts of the larger \nsoftware transparency.  \n SBOM is one type of software component inventory.

This document will apply a similar taxono my for  \nsoftware Producers, Operators, Choosers, and Subscribers. While software writers focus on \ncode quality, software Operators share operational and risk management responsibilities with \nSaaS Producers; the distribution of responsibility is dependent on the makeup of the service \nand its use. This includes understanding the specific risks that concern the Operator, such as third-party risk management. Choosers are responsible for ensuring compliance to standards \nand best practices, which can include the use of SBOMs as well as additional software and \nservice transparency tools.  \n Security is seldom a single party\u2019s responsibility: it is more often a shared responsibility among multiple parties. The nature of most SaaS products is to hide the Producer\u2019s internal solution from the Chooser and Subscriber; Operators know and are able to leverage the functional \ncapabilities of the SaaS but not its internal workings  \u2013 which increases the security \nresponsibilities of the Producer. This generally results in the Operator operating SaaS products \nand services that are well -defined but opaque to Choosers and Subscribers. Ideally, the \nProducer would rapidly remediate all known security issues and be able attest to their actions as \npart of their compliance responsibilities. The Operator can then choose to trust the Producer on \nthe basis of their regulatory compliance attestations.  \nWhat the Shared Responsibility Model Means for SBOM \nSBOMs inventory the software componentry for a software product. When the control of a non-SaaS software product is transferred from the Producer to the Operator, the Operator can store \nits corresponding SBOM in their SBOM management system. Whenever a new  version of the \nsoftware product is issued, the SBOM for the product must be updated in the SBOM \nmanagement tooling.  \nValue of SBOMs in the SaaS Context \nBoth SaaS and non- SaaS software can be large, complicated, and likely to include third -party \ncomponents, including open source software (OSS). Consequently , both suffer from risks \nassociated with complex software supply chains, including but not limited to the inclusion of security vulnerabilities. For both SaaS and non- SaaS software, Choosers and Operators have a \nnatural interest in understanding the composition of the software in use in order to better select and maintain the security of the environment.  \n \n \nCloud Security Technical Reference Architecture.

Indeed, for the Producer of the software and the Chooser, the benef its of SBOMs are \nlargely the same for SaaS as for packaged software. In addition, in the case of SaaS Operators, SBOMs can help with defense- in-depth efforts by increasing the visibility into parts of, or the \nwhole, system without introspecting the system itself (e.g., to determine the risk of an attack or \nthe impact of a vulnerability ). \n Using SBOMs at this scale requires the coordination of disparate teams and a high level of automation. At this time, there are no defined specifications, processes, or tools that perform this task holistically; nor, as noted above, are there norms or standards governing the meaning of SBOM comprehensiveness in a SaaS context.  \nLimitations of SBOM in the SaaS Context  \nFor packaged software, an SBOM provides Choosers and Operators with greater transparency \ninto its composition. A common example of the use of an SBOM is in the case of a critical vulnerability ,\n14 where a software Operator can analyze the SBOM to determine whether a \nsolution includes an affected version of a particular component. It should be noted that Producer SBOMs are likely to be large and complex, and a manual process does not scale.  \n In contrast, four key aspects necessitate additional considerations for the applicability of SBOM for SaaS. First, SaaS systems are frequently changing, and the change is outside the control of, \nand often not visible to, the Chooser and Subscriber. Operators may deploy continuously, \npotentially pushing code multiple times a day with small engineering changes made each time.\n10 \nThe frequency of change raises the question, for all actors, of how to keep track of the \ncomposition of the software.  \n Second, SaaS systems are often part of a larger ecosystem of associated services and tools , so \nthey have more options available when applying security mitigations. For example, a SaaS system may resolve a remote execution issue in a component by stopping all inbound traffic including the malicious payload at the perimeter . This form of mitigation is likely to be much \nfaster to deploy than component updates and, as a change to deployment configuration, does \nnot affect the actual software composition. \n Furthermore, more than one party may be involved in delivering functionality to the Subscriber. For example, an Operator may use a third -party identity provider to provide authentication to a \nservice, or use a third- party storage provider to store customer  data. The net result for the \nSubscriber is a service with little to no transparency as to the provenance or the maintenance of the network of services that are in use. There is no consistent machine- readable way to collate \n \n10 Not all updates will change the software composition, but the software composition, and therefore the \nSBOM, is still changing at a higher rate than non- SaaS. Furthermore, while the software composition may \nnot change, the data (e.g. version) in the SBOM may need to be updated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 3224, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12da6e8c-98a8-489b-ae67-a3ed0636781e": {"__data__": {"id_": "12da6e8c-98a8-489b-ae67-a3ed0636781e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Software Transparency in SaaS Environments.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ec2-user/amazon-neptune-generative-ai-samples/solutions/sbom-chatbot/data/kg_enhanced_rag/Software Transparency in SaaS Environments.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 764130, "creation_date": "2024-08-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c631c3-a536-4a75-a13d-e47bac5608aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Software Transparency in SaaS Environments.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ec2-user/amazon-neptune-generative-ai-samples/solutions/sbom-chatbot/data/kg_enhanced_rag/Software Transparency in SaaS Environments.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 764130, "creation_date": "2024-08-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-22"}, "hash": "e17bb85f75249aedfa36f61e17bdcd6f5e6c23247479363924fa97f735e2f959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7 all the data required to either make decisions on choosing or troubleshooting systems that are in \noperation.  \n \nThird, the technical boundaries of a SaaS product are not as intrinsically defined as that of \npackaged software . No widely accepted definition exists as to the appropriate horizontal or \nvertical extent of software composition data for SaaS. Because of this, individual component inventory implementations may vary, and understanding vendor -specific nuances becomes an \nimportant and unfortunate part of reasoning about SaaS composition. Machine- readability of a \ndata format is little help without a shared understanding of semantics.  \n Lastly, SaaS systems are often, by their nature, opaque as to their implementation. A packaged solution may be directly analyzed by an Operator to determine its composition. A SaaS system \ndoes not typically offer this affordance. While these factors make t he transparency challenging, \nthey do not make it intractable.  \nRecommendations  \nRecognizing the limited transparency measures for SaaS software, the recommendations below \nare offered as initial steps towards Choosers, Operators, and Subscribers gaining visibility into \nthe software components and services that comprise a Producer\u2019s SaaS product. \nSoftware Component Transparency \nChoosers : Request an SBOM from the Operator  \nOperators : Request an SBOM from the Producer  \nSBOMs offer SaaS Choosers and Operators some insight into the components within the SaaS \nproduct.

Even for non -SaaS software, \nSBOMs are not a silver bullet,  and they never claimed to be.  \nSBOMs can be used in conjunction with other transparency practices to enable Choosers and \nOperators to make informed decisions regarding the software that they incorporate into their \noperational domains. These transparency practices include but are not limited to requesting information regarding service identifier, provider, function, protocol, location, agreement, and status, as well as data flow and classifications. The additional data fields supplement the \nsoftware component data provided through the SBOM. SBOMs can also serve as an important \npart of a Provider\u2019s documentation that is integral to obligations for regulatory compliance requirements.  \nFuture Work \nTo address the gaps in transparency for SaaS, additional discussion and analysis from the perspectives of practitioners across the software ecosystem is needed, as well as future work exploring data governance indicators, service availability indicators, r isk indicators, transitive \ndependencies of services, and other risk indicators.  \nData Governance  \nThe work of defining data governance indicators usually falls to compliance or regulatory \nexperts in organizations based on existing policy. One area of discussion is defining \u201cdata handling\u201d descriptors such as whether data is ingested, processed, or forwarded by the service, \nwhat other services have access to the data, and what encryption is being used in transit and at rest. Another area of discussion is \u201cd ata discovery,\u201d which is concerned with identifying user \ndata location and classification. Although the recommended data fields include service l ocation \nand data classification, using the fields to facilitate data discovery is not addressed and requires \nfurther discussion.  \nService Availability Indicators  \nThe terms of  service that are accepted by the consumer typically govern the availability of a \nservice. It would be useful to convert service l evel agreements into a machine- readable format \nso they can be understood by Choosers, Operators, and Subscribers. An example application of \nthis data would be identifying when there is a change in the terms of service so an alternative \nmay be planned for and put in place. Another application is identifying when a certificate expires , and the service is no longer accessible.  \nRisk Indicators  \nIt is well understood that hosted services change frequently due to the DevOps deployment \nworkflow development teams adopt to add features, fix bugs, and make updates. Introducing \nchange in a system introduces risk. Inventory , by design, takes a snapshot of the system at a \npoint in time.

Furthermore, not every change is risky. Discussion on how to identify what parts of \ntransparency data is applicable for risk analysis and what parts can be safely ignored, as well as the scenarios governing these decisions, need further discuss ion. \nTransitive Service Dependency Considerations  \nTransitive service dependencies are important for transparency into SaaS services, but encompassing transitive dependencies in a standardized format is not sufficiently mature to propose at this stage. In a \u201ctraditional\u201d approach to SBOM, it is acknowledged that risks are often not top -level dependency, but in dependencies of dependencies. The NTIA has \nrecommended using interlinking SBOMs .\n13 The need for transparency through multiple levels in \na supply chain is demonstrated by observing risks from low- level inclusions, such as the \ncanonical 2021 Log4J example14.  \n \nThe same can be applied here, including the ability to signal known unknowns. However, \ntracking this data has several important limitations. Not all transitive service dependencies are \nvisible. Some services are more stochastic or driven by user input or user properties. At a logical extreme, by using  third-party services  that in turn could rely on other large services , the \nscope could extend to the entire Internet.  \n \nFurther work is required to clarify this transitive service dependency approach, with a focus on \nmapping to the risk management goals of transparency. Requesting information on direct dependencies in the meantime also offers value, especially for use cases  dealing with sensitive \ndata to be compliant with relevant standards and regulations. In the absence of standardized \nformats for communicating software component and service transparency data, Choosers and \nOperators should initiate discussions with Producers to ensure mutual understanding of SBOM in a SaaS context.  \n \n  \n \n13 NTIA Open Working Group on SBOM Framing.

Using the framing of the four roles (Producer, Chooser, Operator, Subscriber), the introduction of this document noted that the benefits of SBOM apply to multiple roles and points in the software lifecycle. The use cases below do not \napply to all SaaS contexts, but they should help the reader understand the landscape of how \ntransparency can make the overall market for secur ity more efficient. \nProducer  \nThe motivations for a SaaS Producer to generate an SBOM are the same as those of a Producer of non- SaaS. In fact, given the rapid pace of modern application development and the \nincreased number of dependencies used to build and run these applications, tracking components with automation- friendly data is even more important. Providing an SBOM, either \nas a document or as a managed service, to internal teams within the Producer\u2019s organization improves interoperability among internal teams and provides a better picture of the state of the overall service at a given point in time. Sharing SBOM data with a customer communicates transparency and may theref ore, increase vendor trust. Furthermore, providing an SBOM may \nbe required by relevant standards or regulatory bodies or may be used to comply with standards \nof transparency or vulnerability management. Lastly, a Producer may generate an SBOM to fulfill a cus tomer\u2019s request.  \nChooser  \nThe phase of choosing software  applies to the process through which an organization selects \nand opts to use a SaaS product. During this process, the software component and service \ntransparency data also supports the Chooser in addressing concerns and performing due diligence to ensure they are meeting their commitments to protect company and customer data \nthat the SaaS Producer and Operator might be responsible for. SBOM data can support this \ndecision in a number of ways beyond checking for known vulnerabil ities. Automated analysis \ncan surface questions about risks from end -of-life or end -of-support versions, or risks from OSS \nprojects with insufficient support. SBOM data can also be used in analysis around technical debt or licensing concerns, which would help a potential customer get a more realistic picture of total \ncost- of-ownership or potential risk of data and functional lock -in.  \n \nThe Chooser should be aware that they are receiving SBOM data that represents a static snapshot; this is particularly important to note given the dynamic nature of SaaS products. Since \nthe SaaS Producer and Operator will be accepting a greater share of the  risk (compared to the \ndistribution of risk management responsibility in non- SaaS) to protect the potential customer, \nunderstanding the potential risks in the SaaS product is an important part of the decision-\nmaking process.

Software component and service transparency is useful to \nSaaS Operators as it allows them to understand how their acquired software works in the context of other service providers.  \nSubscriber  \nThe primary mediation method between the Subscriber and the SaaS is through legal contracts (e.g., Terms of Service), a news feed, or status feed provided by the Operator. From this perspective, an SBOM itself does not provide any relevant information to the Subscriber. However, Subscribers can ask for other information described in this document\u2019s \nrecommendations. During the lifetime of the Subscriber\u2019s use of the SaaS, the Subscriber may \ntransition to the Chooser persona in response to new information about the security or \nperformance of the SaaS.  \nIllustrative Use Case: Recent Vulnerability Example  \nIn September 2023, a critical vulnerability, CVE -2023- 486315 (heap buffer overflow in libwebp), \nwas found in the webp format widely used by software producers as part of their products and \nservices. This vulnerability created confusion and extra work to determine if a particular piece of software was vulnerable due to the lack of software component transparency for the affected \nproducts.  \n This scenario offers an opportunity to discuss how the four actors respond to new vulnerability information. The owner of libwebp provided a fix for the vulnerability and published the issue. The library component producer did what was required of them. Now, everyone who utilizes this \nsoftware will need to  recognize their responsibility to patch using the provided software. The \nlibrary component producer does not have visibility into where their vulnerable code is being used to be more proactive in helping to mitigate this vulnerability.  \n \nThe following use cases are examples that illustrate an organization\u2019 s concerns and \nconsiderations in light of the vulnerability scenario described above. These examples offer one \npossible path forward for responding to a CVE in the SaaS context and are not intended to be restrictive or prescriptive.  \n \nProducer  \nSaaS Producers using this library as a first -level dependency may choose whether to update \nthe library. The SaaS Producer may have transitive dependencies that use the library, and those third- parties may also choose whether to update the library.

The SBOM may also \nserve as proof of mitigation if the SBOM is detailed enough (includes transitive dependencies).  \n \nChooser  \nAn organization is looking for a SaaS solution for managing its customer data. In considering cloud- based options from SaaS vendors, the organization requests an SBOM from vendors and \nuses the SBOM in its decision- making process. An SBOM allows the Chooser  to identify \nvulnerabilities, in this case libwebp. This is important considering the libwebp vulnerability, as \nthe library\u2019s presence in an SBOM is now an indicator of a risk that a Chooser has to be concerned about when making risk management decisions. They may also be considering vendor transparency, response times, and the quality of the vendor\u2019s response to the vulnerability. The risk, especially in a SaaS environment, can be best evaluated in detail based \non Producer attestations in the form of an SBOM.  \n \nOperator  \nIn response to the CVE, the Operator reviews available resources to gather information about the vulnerability to find the relevant services, libraries, and transitive dependencies. This \nresearch may include reviewing relevant SBOMs to assess the vulnerability\u2019s impact on the Operator\u2019s software. Based on this information, the Operator may take actions to mitigate immediate risk and may also evaluate and consider more secure software development \npractices.  \n \nSubscriber  \nThe Subscriber, in this scenario, uses a SaaS to host their data. In light of the CVE, the \nSubscriber may be concerned about the security of their data and look for information from their \nSaaS Operator. The Subscriber does not have direct visibility into the vulnerability\u2019s impact on \nthe SaaS. As a result, the Subscriber will be working with the SaaS Operator to obtain information and/or mitigations for the impact of the vulnerability on their service.  \n \nWhen the subscription cycle allows, the Subscriber may revisit the Chooser role and re- evaluate \ncontinuing the service relationship with the Operator.
